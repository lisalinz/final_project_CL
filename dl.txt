Okay, the thing is, this isn't a movie you can really rate on a site like this because a few things need to be taken into account:1) It was a statue. Some of this is meant to be seen in 3D. 2) It's non-narrative. Even for Lynch, there's no real way to approach it, only "experience it". Which in the case of seeing it in real life, would be vastly interesting, but through the medium of the television it's only slightly so. Think about it like seeing a screensaver picture of the Eiffel Tower instead of being there. You can still appreciate it's magnificence, but you still haven't seen it. 3) It was an experiment. An award winning experiment, but still an experiment.So for that, it's at least interesting. It honestly makes me want to see the actual set up to get a better idea of what all the various forms helped do for each other (animation, projection, sculpture, painting, etc.). But as a filmed medium, it's just something to sit and watch a while, nod your head in acceptance, and move on.Still, I'd check it out. The idea behind it is inventive enough that maybe it'll open up more ideas for like experiments or further experiments.--PolarisDiB
Lynch explains on the DVD that he was inspired to make a moving painting and that is just what he did.  As per usual with Lynch, there is no explanation for what is going on (actually, with this short, there doesn't even seem to be a reason for what's going on) but it is somehow beautiful in its repetition.
I remember Lynch was once quoted as saying that he was initially a painter, but he wanted the paintings to move, just a little bit, & that's what got him into animation.This short is a good example of that - it portrays six figures on a wall vomiting, complete with visible internal organs, then catching on fire. The visuals are accompanied by a siren. Originally, the 40 second short was screened on a loop at an exhibition, which ran indefinitely. The DVD of Lynch's short films has it repeated 6 times.No story, no characters - it really is more like a moving painting than a 'short film', more at home in a gallery as an installation than in a darkened cinema. The crude, but striking, animation style is similar to that which Lynch later used in 'The Alphabet' & 'The Grandmother', although they did include plotlines & characters, bizarre though they were.Well worth a look, if only to see where this great director's career started.
This first film from David Lynch is not really a film at all. It is better to think of it as a moving painting. Its origins bear this out. Lynch was working on a picture while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts when he felt a 'little wind' and wished that the painting could move. This set him to work on creating an animated composition which became Six Men Getting Sick.It consists of a screen with three sculptures built into its top left corner. These three figures are casts of Lynch himself. This screen then has an animation projected onto it. The animation adds a further three figures. It connects the stomachs to the heads. They fill up, hands appear over the distressed heads, the word 'Sick' flashes up and the heads catch fire and vomit. All of this is accompanied by a repetitive siren wail.Because the image is projected onto a sculpture it's fair to say that this is really a 3D art installation rather than a film. When it was shown at an art competition it was repeated on a continual loop. On DVD this is reduced to six cycles. The repetition does make sense though as it allows you to see different things each time. It certainly indicates what an original artist Lynch was even at this early stage.
This is the film portion of a sculpture that had images projected on it.Its basically abstract people getting sick and throwing up.Sort of.As I said its all abstract so the figures are only reasonably human.The image runs about a minute and then is repeated several times, which was then looped into endless illness.How do you rate that?I don't know. Its fine for what it is but as anything beyond that it isn't much.
David Lynch once said about how he came to start making films."One night I was drawing a garden in my studio, immersed in a thick black night, where green grass seemed to dilute this bottomless darkness, and I sat down beside my picture, began to peer at it, and I heard the wind blowing and My picture was rustled with grass, and then I thought, "Oh,the moving painting!" "And so he realized that he wants to shoot / draw "moving pictures" called films. And this work, his first work, is so simple, so genius. In its essence, this is the true image of the philosophy with which Lynch still pictures his paintings. This is nothing more than a painting that constantly changes its state, and all this translates into a moving picture.It is with this thought you need to look at this picture. It is she who will give you a complete idea of ​​the primary thought Lynch shot his greatest works ("Mallholland Dr.", "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet").Looking at this disturbing picture, you can experience the same sensations as when looking at pictures of surrealists, such as Salvador Dali. And if you are suddenly not familiar with the works of Lynch at all, then I advise you to understand and feel his view of the cinema precisely from this work, and what undisclosed potential the cinematography possesses, not playing with your intellect, and not even with your eyes, but with your subconscious mind ...
Stills for this 60 second film are available on the Web, and the film itself is shown during the Pretty as a Picture documentary.The images are quite arresting. Lynch himself said of the project "I always sort of wanted to do films. Not so much a movie-movie as a film-painting. I wanted the mood of the painting to be expanded through film, sort of a moving painting. It was really the mood I was after. I wanted a  sound with it that would be so strange, so beautiful, like if the Mona Lisa opened her mouth and turned, and there would be a wind, and then she'd turn back and smile. It would be strange."By the way, Lynch shared the first-place in the second annual Dr. William S. Biddle Cadwalader Memorial Prize. One of the judges on the panel funded Lynch's next film project, and there it is--the start of a career.
The repeating of the film 6 times is essential in order to become acquainted with the sequence and give you the opportunity to look in different areas of the screen to catch other cool visuals.  I loved this little film, it showcases the twisted, genius mind of Lynch at an early age.  This can be found with his other shorts on a new DVD that I just picked up.  Its an amazing find if you can get a copy.  9/10
Spoilers herein.There's no question that Lynch is one of the most interesting film artists today. This is because he knows how to fold the seemingly perverse with dreamlike shifts and rhythms while at the same time weaving a reflexive annotation on the fact that he is being reflexive.You can see all of that even in this early project. There's no special insight here, just confirmation.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
Director David Lynch has creativity running from every orifice of his body, but this, his first short film, is just bizarre, pointless and dumb. It's one of those concept ideas, where people are supposed to say, "My goodness! How genius!" but instead it's just dumb. It gives what it promises, nothing more, maybe less.Ugly animation of six men puking is multiplied by six to make this truly ugly little short. Meanwhile, to go along with our repetitive picture, we have some ugly music playing. A total of 36 animated puking men, with constant deja vu's.This is just an uninteresting mess. I can't imagine people actually sitting through the entire thing to enjoy it time after time, unlike some short films. This one has no substance, and no redeeming qualities, and it's quite hideous to look at. It's as though someone were to rub feces on a mantle and hang it in an art gallery. It's disgusting looking and smelling, but after turning away once in disgust, you have to look at it five more times.It's good to see David Lynch's film-making improved greatly since this short. This must've been his stance trying to become the Salvidore Dali of short film making, but alas, he didn't quite make the cut.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 4 mins.
Soon 50 years ago, David Lynch shot his very first short film named "Six Figures Getting Sick". It's as weird as you expect from him, but beyond that there's really nothing watchworthy at all about this little piece. There is no real story or character development and it's basically exactly what the titles says: 4 minutes of animation in which men throw up in all kinds of colors and constitutions. Pretty gross actually and no artistic value at all. The one thing it has in common with some of his later works is that he already used the strong contrast between the B&W-setting and different shades of red and purple. Nonetheless, this may be his worst work to date, but it's kinda excusable as he was still defining his style. His takes on the alphabet and grandmothers from not much later were clearly superior to this one already and I'm glad he did not choose the constant noise of sirens from this one as a recurring theme for his later works. It's really one to watch for Lynch completionists only. Everybody else should give it a pass.
WHEN WE SAW this recently thanx to our good friends at TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES we were quite surprised: A) That there really was such a film with such a title, B) That an outfit like TCM actually did televise such, C) That we watched it and finally D) That we are doing a review.IN MANY WAYS the very brief tidbit of what can only be referred to as limited (very limited) animation. In some respects it appears to be a sort of intentional throwback to the very earliest animation to be committed to film. In our mind, that means the short (3 + minute) titled HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES (Stuart Bracton/Vitagraph, 1906).IN SOME AREAS, the cartoon succeeds in doing this as an homage to both the artist, as well as to the art-form as well. It is in the beginnings of animation in this embryonic stage and form that started both artist and producer on the road to the shorts and full length features that we take for granted.IN SHORT, without HUMOROUS FACES, there'd be no FANTASIA.ON THE OTHER hand, we get the distinct impression that the cartoonist and the producer really did want to gross out the audience and induce gastro-intestinal maladies. This would seem to be superfluous as we don't learn anything that we don't already know and have all experienced for ourselves.SO SORRY TO report to Animator/Director/Producer Mr. David Lynch, that no one was edified in the extended display of vomiting, puking, wreching, hurling and heaving; nor by displays of dysentery, diarrhea, the runs or the scutters.WELL SCHULTZ, DO you think anyone's shocked?
Six Men Getting Sick (1966) ** 1/2 (out of 4) David Lynch's first film is an animated short running four minutes that shows exactly what the title says. The animation is ugly, the soundtrack annoying but these two things are what makes the film work. The film is rather surreal in a weird sort of way but this fits the director just fine.Alphabet, The (1968) *** (out of 4) David Lynch's second film is a four-minute short of a nightmare with a woman in bed saying the alphabet. This is an extremely weird short but at the same time it's perfectly surreal and just downright strange. The bizarre images of the woman spitting up blood are eerie to say the least. This certainly isn't a film to show you kids to each them to say their ABC's.
I heard of this short film recently as it being David Lynch's first and it interested me enough to find it. The first thing to say is that it is not really a film but an art installation based on animated paintings of, well, precisely what the title says. The soundtrack is a constant siren wail and the animation loops endlessly while the figures have their stomachs filled with the sense of nausea and then vomit down the screen. In terms of content it is really offputting and once I'd seen a few loops of it I had really seen as much as I wanted to. I guess for fans of David Lynch then it will be important to see this as part of checking out as much of his work as possible but for the majority of us it will just confirm that Lynch always had an eye and a preference for the odd and the disturbing.
So nine people have seen this film?Seeing as the film was essentially a temporary piece of installation art, a loop of film projected onto a sculpture as part of an exhibition back in 1966, I have a very genuine interest in talking to those people - they must have some interesting stories to tell.
I just saw Six Figures Getting Sick-David Lynch's first foray into film-on YouTube when I typed David Lynch. The title is basically the short's description as repetitiously we see six heads vomiting red into their hearts while the word "sick" flashes on the screen. Then a different image of the same thing happens and all this is repeated a total of six times to a constant wailing siren. Interesting at first, it all does get a little..."repetitious". Still, if you're used to the weirdness that comes with the territory of David Lynch, you should feel right at home at this experimental short of the director's early years. Everyone else, you've been warned.
This short film has lots of implicit messages hidden in a rough and simple animation. The title for itself, "Six men getting sick (six times)" contains, quite deliberately, the Devil's mark 666, and the never ending, irritating siren howling, is maybe a not secondary aspect of the evil invention created by the young Lynch. The idea of figures vomiting, of represent them with their stomach getting full and exploding is not a simple one. It comes from the inner consciousness of the author, pouring out as the vomit on the audience, and giving it a strong feeling (weirdness, fear, repugnance, it does not matter: the aim of Lynch is rousing people from indolence). So, I think this one is the first step of the career of a great director, even a jump, for it creates tension and dizziness with a poor budget, a simple animation and a recognizable genius.
These are relatively still figures doing a variety of regurgitations. No one but David Lynch would even try this. He is the soul of the nightmare. Messing with us is his game. Someone asked me once what five people I would like to meet. One of them is David Lynch because he encapsulates the awfulness of the netherworld better than anyone I know.
Probably the best, or most engrossed, I found myself in David Lynch's first short film effort- animated of course- was that in his use of repetition there were more chances to spot things not seen the previous time. This is really in some ways rather disgusting in its own abstracted art-school sense, but it grew on me the more times I saw these 'six figures' going through their digestive problems. There's a mix of colors used in an animated style that I haven't seen much since I was younger (it was done here and there on these kids videos I watched, the lower rent ones, heh). The alarm sound that blares, what Lynch himself described as the 'sound' attributed to the moving painting he tried to recreate, is my least favorite part of the short. I almost wished Lynch had gone the Brakhage route, leaving just the images to speak for themselves. What I did really find interesting though on a purely film-student level however was how I liked it the more times it repeated itself, trying to get the viewer to see into what is being done with the ink marks and various blotches of ideas in forms of smoke and vomit. Nothing too outrageous or speaking of the future genius he'd show, but it would've been something I'd given high marks for if I was judging whatever contest he originally submitted this to forty years ago- it definitely carries that appeal.
It's hard to review stuff like this, because rather than being a proper short, it's more like an "animated sculpture/painting". Perhaps nowadays it might be seen as something utterly pointless, but is still has a certain "mesmerizing" feel, speciallt considering it was done long way before animated gifs were a thing.And from the very beginning, and even at its simplest form, David Lynch's films are still nightmarishly eerie.
I really enjoyed this for what it was, a piece of art. Now I usually like a story along with that but I felt as though this film didn't need it. It was very repetitive but it was interesting to see and think of how Lynch put it all together. I would say that this is far from one of his best but I still had a great time watching it. I feel as though this film is necessary for Lynch fans to see because it captures his tone and feeling very well. I loved most of his work and I really liked this as well. Apparently this is his first film and if that's true, I am very impressed and I hope to someday make something as good. Check this one out and enjoy some Lynch magic!
Dont know what to say to this short .its pretty disturbing : we witnessed six men who vomit and get sick .the real interest of this short is the animation and the way its presented : pretty interesting and have some interesting moments but thats all.
At the time that this made David Lynch was an art student. He had never made a film before and it kind of shows. There is no plot nor are there any characters save the titular figures who get sick six times. Before I watched it I assumed it would be a hand drawn cartoon and that it would be silent. I don't know why I expected this I just did. So you could say that the film kind of took me by surprise though I'd hesitate to say that it was pleasant. I'd also be lying if I said I liked it or that it wasn't really annoying the third rotation. It's not that I don't like Lynch. I do. I like Eraserhead which has a similar type of mindset. This just holds no appeal for me other than as a study.
As in most of Lynch's films, the viewer can't really tell what's truly going on, and interpretation is left up to him.However, for me, this felt basically pointless, if not for the object of artistic experimentation within animation. The repetitious aspect of the film, short as it is, is what most bugged me. I felt as if I was sitting across from an awkward man-child who was trying to stuff crackers through his nostrils, repeatedly and unsuccessfully, or something strange, staring at me with huge eyes, as if he expected me to react in some way. Awkward and uncomfortable. Then again, this does almost have a certain level of interest. What exactly tickled my curiosity I don't quite know.Anyhow, its worth a look if you enjoy Lynch's work and presume to understand it, which probably no one entirely does. Still interesting to see what his early work was like.
Lynch made this little piece as an art student in Philadelphia. It cost him $200 and it won him first prize in an experimental art contest.  The first film on his Short Films DVD, available on his website, It's interesting enough to watch on DVD, but must have been even more mind blowing, live in Philly, in the late 60's.
OK, writing a review of a two minute short film is a challenge, hence this being the first. We see a man walking through a field of tall grass. He is walking almost zombie like, wearing normal clothes for the time and his hands and face are blue. He walks up to a woman who is sitting with her back facing him. She does not turn around but we see her face and it is painted white and she has her mouth open, lips painted red. The man stops in back of her and begins to unzip his pants. He reaches in and proceeds to pull out...weeds. At first I thought they might be dandelions because they look like yellow flowers but it is a weed called yellow hawkweed if i'm not mistaken. So he proceeds to pull out one weed after another and then he looks into the camera shocked and then falls to the ground, motionless. The girl stays stationary, having never moved. End. What does it all mean? Who cares. It's a decent two minute visual from Lynch, the second short film he did (the first being Six Figures Getting Sick, the year before) from 1967 when he was 21. When the guy unzips his pants standing over the girl, I have to admit, seeing as how it's Lynch I thought, "No. Is this guy really going to pull it out?" And because it's Lynch something unexpected would of course happen. Anyway, check out Lynch's second short film that he ever did and then watch the rest. The Alphabet comes next the following year.
"Absurd Encounter with Fear" is a 2-minute short film that will have its 50th anniversary next year and was made by the pretty famous and prolific filmmaker David Lynch during the early years of his career. It is about what happens when a man and a woman meet in a corn field. The woman is played by David Lynch's first wife Peggy, the man is Jack Fisk, who later became a 2-time Oscar nominee in completely different fields than acting, namely for art direction and production design, also very recently on "The Revenant". So yeah, the story in this film here is not too good and Lynch did not succeed to create a memorable experience in these 120 seconds. Of course, this is also a major challenge. In terms of style, he delivers nicely as usual in terms of visuals and audio. But that is not enough to let me recommend the film. Thumbs down.
Very unsure what is going on in David Lynch's mind during this short film, but i can say that their is a degree of symbolism and humor in it. During the first part of the short the guy/ghost/zombie/soulless character is walking through a field going past the camera. Next shot is composed of the guy slowly approaching a girl that is, what looks to be sitting in the fetal position. The girl could resemble innocence, but through the short it is hard to tell what David Lynch's motive was for these characters. The girl looks ahead the whole time in the short almost like the guy was unexpected or unnoticed.In he next scene the guy figure is proceeding to pull out some kind of flowers out of his pants. the flowers could be dandelions, or from a previous post Yellow Hawkweed, but the motive in my opinion is this figure could be trying to take the girl figures innocence away from her. The cameraman switches to a sharp zoom out shots before the next scene, then with the man still taking the flowers out of his zipper, the cameraman makes a second sharp zoom out shot with the man staring blankly into the camera. Very dark at this pointing and the top portion of his face is dark and mysterious. He then falls to the ground in the next scene and lays there motionlessly. The camera rolls for approx twenty nine seconds and i noticed the girl figures head slowly slouched down looking hopeless. I myself, don't know if the girls head slouching was intentional or preferably just something that happened, but the end of the short film and the music selection left me confused,uncomfortable, scared, and a little bit humorous. Overall for cheap shots and a fast scripting, i believe that this short is worth watching just for a small scare and giggles.
If you're reading this review in the first place then you've read the short IMDb summary which reads, "A man approaches a woman in a field." Good description as that is essentially what happens. Jack Fisk (David Lynch's best friend) wears a ghoulish pale white face in the vein of Carnival of Souls. He runs across a field somewhere to a girl (Peggy Lynch) sitting down. Such a premise could have gone in multiple ways. I could imagine this same scenario in a romantic way but for Lynch it's all based on fear. The pale white face paint the man wears, the music that plays, the way that he just stands over the woman after he's gone up to her. It is all very eerie. What makes it more so is how he begins pulling flowers out of his pants which couldn't be more disturbing. The film ends with Fisk looking at the camera abruptly. Given the fact that it's Lynch and how abstract it obviously is it's very open to interpretation, though I'll not use this space to explain my view on what the film means. I believe this was Lynch's second short film and it's a lot better than his first.
2 minutes of intrigue, chaos and absurdity. It is difficult to say more about such a short film without writing a summary. As any viewer will notice, the key moment is when the man stands over the girl. What does it mean? I don't know at all, but it's worth watching just for the sake of seeing it. After all, this is the beginning of David's career.
Based on an actual event, Lynch's niece had a nightmare where she recited the alphabet in her sleep, this film is basically the same thing, with a young woman reciting the alphabet in her sleep while we see nightmarish imagery.Its an interesting piece with truly frightening images. Unfortunately the animation isn't all that spectacular, consisting of animated drawings. Its a good piece that mostly works and shows the seeds of the later Eraserhead.If you come across one of the short film videos of Lynch's early work this film, and one or two others, makes it worth renting.
VERY weird short by David Lynch. It's in black and white and shows a girl who looks like she's going completely mad while the letters of the alphabet go flying around her. She also sings that alphabet song.I should have expected something weird from Lynch but this is even stranger than I thought it could be. In 4 short minutes he gives you a morbid and disturbing little story about the alphabet and terror. It doesn't make a bit of sense but the imagery is so strange and the sound so odd that you're pulled right in. Basically a short little horror film. You can see where "Eraserhead" came from. Worth seeing but only for those who don't scare easily. An 8.
David Lynch says this film was an attempt at visualizing the "fear of learning." In it, a young girl is tortured by the alphabet in a competely abstract nightmare. Lynch has always been fascinated by the darker side of dreams, the seemingly nonsensical black procession of symbols and fears, and this film simply adds another phobia to the canon.We are shown images of a head with information going in one side, and this eventually causes the head to erupt into a black mess. Lynch juxtaposes the most innocent of subjects (the alphabet), which usually marks the beginning of our schooling, with disconcerting images of blood and vomit. Disturbing? Yes. Lynch apparently formed the idea after hearing of a girl who was found reciting the alphabet during a nightmare.On a more profound level, the film examines a fear that perhaps appears for most later in life: the dread of knowledge. There's quite a bit of truth to the oft-repeated line "ignorance is bliss." Gradually, we realize that the more we learn, the less we understand, and therefore, the less control we have over our situations. It's a problem that has vexed people since the conception of "science." We ask questions out of curiosity, find there are no accessible answers, create a religious penumbra that satisfies a great deal with a few simple passages, and then science comes along and we are confronted once again with the inconsistencies of our faith. Thus, we fear that which turns the rock-solid black and whites of our existence to a confused mass of gray.Also, The Alphabet hints at what linguists and intellectuals and songwriters have known for centuries; words are wholly inadequate to describe even the simplest of human perceptions. And once one has etched that list of letters into one's mind, in a sense, there is no turning back. Life becomes shapes patterned on paper, and conceptions of reality will no longer be formed purely and internally; they are immediately attached to an imperfect language and remained tethered to that which will never truly suffice.
Lynch's first film is a bizarre, revolting and terrifying account of a bedridden young girl apparently being tortured by the alphabet. The letters appear as weird, threatening shapes which (as in his follow-up The Grandmother) seem to take on plant form. The girl herself eventually vomits blood.The film's meaning isn't clear, and is really of less important than the visuals, which are themselves like moving paintings. The innocence of the child's 'ABC' rhyming song is warped to give a frighteningly naive background to the horrific events.Lynch's trademark is the expression of fear, and this short foregrounds that motif in the most disturbing way imaginable. Fans of this director should try and catch his debut, as it casts its shadow over much of his later work.
This was the first time David Lynch shot live-action footage. It isn't really a narrative film, like The Grandmother, but its more than a filmed moving painting like Six Men Getting Sick. It is mainly animation, truth be told, but it combines live action with it. This is what a child's nightmare looks like inside David Lynch's head - and let me tell you, its quite disturbing, on a par with Grandmother and Eraserhead.Some of its images, like the girl bleeding from the mouth and reciting the alphabet - i can't get out of my head. I don't know if that's a good thing... Lynch is a very strange man, indeed. And what we get in his films isn't half the story, as members of his website will tell you. There are images there that you wouldn't even know to be wary of, to not think about - images you don't even know to protect yourself from. But as Elephant Man showed us, he is also a master director, who can control himself and a major production to perfection. As Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Dr showed us, Lynch's world can also be lots of fun. He's one of my favourite filmmakers because he gives me both fun AND haunting in the same frame - a feat not many can do.
Alphabet, The (1968) *** (out of 4) David Lynch's second film is a four-minute short of a nightmare with a woman in bed saying the alphabet. This is an extremely weird short but at the same time it's perfectly surreal and just downright strange. The bizarre images of the woman spitting up blood are eerie to say the least. This certainly isn't a film to show you kids to each them to say their ABC's.Six Men Getting Sick (1966) ** 1/2 (out of 4) David Lynch's first film is an animated short running four minutes that shows exactly what the title says. The animation is ugly, the soundtrack annoying but these two things are what makes the film work. The film is rather surreal in a weird sort of way but this fits the director just fine.
"The Alphabet" is a really bizarre experimental film short from David Lynch. It contains images that nightmares are made of. Many strange and abstract objects give birth to the letters of the alphabet. There is many creepy sound effects that give this little short film's imagery a strange hallucinatory and hypnotic feel. I could definitely see a Salvadore Dali influence during the film's animated scenes. David Lynch's former wife Peggy than sings the alphabet song against a black background. Wow, the alphabet song has never sounded more horrifying! It's like a preschooler's worst fears caught on film. If you can find a copy of David Lynch's short films, you won't be disappointed. There's no doubt about it, David Lynch is an artist who comes up with some of the most amazing nightmarish imagery.
David Lynch's earliest work... a short film that somehow involves a girl (Peggy Lynch) and the alphabet, and what seems to be the most screwed-up nightmare anyone could ever possibly imagine. What inspires this sort of thing? I have no idea.The film has been called "avant garde", and I really can't think of a better classification. I'd say something a bit more vulgar, but I won't. One reviewer said this film is what should have been on the tape in "The Ring", and I think that's a fine suggestion. This could scare the pants off of many people.If you've seen Lynch's films, and I recommend pretty much all of them, you know he's capable of some messed-up imagery. I mean, the ear in "Blue Velvet"? Or all of "Lost Highway"? Crazy weird. But after you see this early work, you'll understand that Lynch has been weird for over forty years...
This avant garde piece miraculously comes off without being cliché or dismissible (as is so common with artsy avant garde film).  Peggy Lynch (I'm assuming is his daughter) goes through a sequence of harrowing events that had some connection with the alphabet.  I particularly liked the bed-wetting and the dirt.  The person I watched this with said the dirt looked very "inviting."  I strangely agreed.  Only Lynch could make dirt inviting. Very interesting work.  8/10
I love this short movie by David Lynch.  The movie, on the surface, is about a girl being tortured by the alphabet.  A very surreal part in this movie for me was when the thing that melts when hit with the alphabet letters melts and that face says "Please try to remember you're dealing with the human form."  I just love that part of this movie.  Anyway, if you can find this movie, see it.  If you're into surreal movies and abstract art, you'll love this.
The second of David Lynch's films, The Alphabet, is a significant progression from his debut Six Men Getting Sick. Where the latter was a short piece of static animation, The Alphabet incorporates stop-motion and live action alongside the animated sequences. It's a much more interesting film that achieves an undoubted nightmarish mood.Its genesis was a story Lynch's wife Peggy told him. She had witnessed her young niece experience a nightmare. In a little bed in a darkened room her niece recounted the alphabet in her tormented sleep. From this story Lynch devised a short film that approximates the feeling of a nightmare, one specifically where the fear connected with learning is the source of the unease. There is an alphabet song the like of which would be sung in schools, but removed into this context seems very disturbing. This is probably the first example of Lynch taking a seemingly harmless everyday thing and making it sinister with well chosen associative images and sounds. Indeed this is also the first time that the director utilises sound to disquieting effect, something he would become a master of. Here, we have not only the alphabet song sung by Peggy but also distorted baby crying. The latter being a recording he made of his daughter Jennifer that was corrupted because the tape recorder was faulty. But it was a mistake that produced a result the director loved, and it is indeed a disturbing sound that accentuates the mood perfectly. The Alphabet works often on a subconscious level but it does have a central core idea derived from the alphabet dream that is visualised here. A girl with a white face in a bed in a darkened room experiences the terror of the dream and ends up hemorrhaging blood all over her white night gown and bed sheets. It's a disturbing image but it represents a reaction to the forced learning that initiated the dream in the first place.With this film Lynch moved forward in an important way. It's the first time where his dark sensibility was used in a way that approximated the mood of a nightmare.
lynch has, with this short, somehow managed to recreate with disturbing accuracy the experience of any childhood nightmare. on watching you are instantly transported back to being 6 years old, wanting desperately to wake up and not being able to. you have to wonder at the fact that lynch has reproduced this experience to such effect that when it is finished you're left with that morning after feeling of relief that the dream is over, yet also that lingering discomfort as the memory gradually fades. to be able to recreate on film with such accuracy, the sub-conscious experience of people everywhere is an impressive achievement. i wish i could do it... disturbing yet brilliant.
David Lynch captivates me at every turn. Fortunately, I started seeing his works when I was well into adulthood, or I never would have recovered from them, frightened child that I was. Here he takes the most mundane of learning experiences, learning the alphabet, and makes them the horror of horrors. I know this is primitive, but it really worked for me.
This was set off the basic thematic elements of Lynch's oeuvre. Psychosubconscious horror imagery involving blood, sex, and rich textures of malaise. What's different about this is that it actually goes further, into a child's realm of disturbing imagery, which can be even more disturbing because thinking of Lynch dealing with children is kind of appalling--The Straight Story aside.I think it's probably my favorite short of his, though, considering that it so well mixes everything in animation, stop motion, and real motion, and that overall it's quite adept at forcing you to think about all those children's shows that involve alphabet songs and alphabet animations dancing around, and how a lot of that stuff can be very disconcerting and bizarre if really looked at.Furthermore, I believe it's probably one of his best uses of sound. Lynch is a genius at making sound affect imagery beyond levels that most directors use, and while the sound in this short are much more self-conscious and much more apparent than the underlying growling of most of his work, it's a lot more effective.--PolarisDiB
If you missed your abc-education from the Sesame Street during your preschool-years no worries. David Lynch will teach you the basics in this less-than-4-minute short film. The frame to the story is an extremely pale, possible sick woman lying in bed right at the beginning and also at the end. We see a strange structure rising including the letters a to z and more and more growing as the alphabet proceeds. After a short cut to a pout with red lipstick we hear all the different ways in which the letter a can be shouted, some sounds downright creepy. Then we see an animated female figure having the letters put, literally put, into her head, which, not long after, explodes from the pressure. The blood is particularly memorable as the rest of the film is almost exclusively inconspicuous shades of gray. Then finally the cut back to Lynch's wife at this point who sings the alphabet song before she faces a similar fate like the previous girl, only she exhales the letters and the other had them inserted.This short-film is indeed very Lynch. If you like his abstract, surreal works, you'll probably have a good time watching, otherwise you'll wonder what in God's name is going on or even be downright appalled. You won't feel nothing though, that much is safe.
Not sure what attracted me to this film, which is really nothing more than, as David Lynch puts it on the DVD, an interpretation of someone else's dream through his own state of mind. But I really, really felt immersed in what Lynch was doing visually with the film. Obviously, it doesn't make a lick of sense if you're looking for it, but I loved the mixture of different elements within the medium. There's actual film shot of Lynch's wife Peggy going rather bonkers while in a bed. Then this is mixed around with animation treated on-TOP of the filmed footage. Then there is other mixed media, such as a filmed animated spot shook around with other pieces of color and light. There's even a quick shot of black falling down upon white, if that makes sense (which it doesn't). I was told by some others that this one was the weakest of the Lynch shorts, but that goes without saying that each one of his early works will divide viewers like in any good old art-school class. If one knows though the lengths to which the filmmaker is ready to portray his audio-visual interpretations on screen one might appreciate it a little more if they just happen to stumble upon it. On a personal level it's one of the best student works I've seen from the period of a promising talent.
Just saw this, another weird short directed by David Lynch early in his career, on YouTube. In it, you hear kids saying loudly in unison, "A-B-C! A-B-C!" Then there are some animation that turns bizarre like when a tube gives birth to a couple of A's as you hear a baby crying. Then there's this woman (played by Peggy Lynch, David's first wife) who recites the alphabet singing who suddenly bleeds through her nose after she's done. Oh, and it's dark and she's in her bed the whole time. The end. There are some other bizarre things here but I'll just leave you to search this on YouTube. After all that, I'll say this for David Lynch: He's certainly like no one else on film!
Many films, or books, or any form of media will challenge the mind and make you think in order to draw your own conclusions. What this short film feels like, is something that wasn't written with too much depth. The direction was what the time was spent on making this, not any kind of deep writing, and because of that, this short film suffers from a lack of any kind of coherent anything.A girl lays in bed and begins having nightmares about the alphabet. The beginning is live action, and the middle moves into animated territory where the letters are given birth to and nightmarishly appearing. The film ends with a weird upside down face, and the girl from the opening reciting the alphabet, only to then throw up blood. It's quite original, but at the same time, quite impossible to comprehend.The acting...well, there's one actress and she is fine. The direction is very atmospheric and creepy. The background is almost always black, and the constant chanting of the ABC's is both strange and eerie. The writing is what I question. Director David Lynch must have had something in mind for what this meant...no I don't think so. It really doesn't seem to mean anything. It's just a creepy short about an alphabetic nightmare that can really only be taken at face value. The deeper you dive into what this means, the less sense it makes. Let's just call it an experiment with animation and direction and leave it at that.This short is effectively scary, but missing the substance necessary to make a short that has some sort of meaning. Yet these disturbing images are still tattooed on my brain(?)...My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 4 mins.
Only a filmmaker liked David Lynch would be able to turn something so simple and mundane as a recitation of the alphabet into something so terrifying. And yet, I found this short film to be incredibly fascinating, mostly because of the nightmarish nature of it.While there have been many feature length films and shorts that try to make a depiction of the human psyche, none of those works had the same visual intensity and dream-like quality of the works directed by David Lynch, which I consider to be timeless and beautifully made (In a dark, twisted way) Of all the shorts directed by David Lynch, this one is my favorite.
I'm a huge Lynch fan so I'm always excited to see his work.This piece however feels a little muddled and ineffective. I guess considering it's based on his niece's dream it makes sense that it doesn't have any kind of logic. But that makes it less interesting to watch as there is no real original vision behind the piece.Maybe good to screen as a short before Eraserhead or something.
I found the short pretty weird and too much short .we cant understand really what happened .it s not really explicit but we can still have an interpretation of a dream .But clearly it was weird.
This is probably one of the worst films you could use to teach your child the actual alphabet. While it does contain each of the letters of the alphabet, and in an extremely memorable sequence, you child will likely be very scarred if shown this film. It feels like it was just a nightmare David Lynch had and he decided to adapt to the screen.A lot of Lynch's early short films like "Six Figures Getting Sick" or "Absurd Encounter with Fear" aren't all too spectacular (I mean, they're okay, but they lack anything really good in them), but "The Alphabet" is definitely one of the better ones.It feels sort of similar to "Eraserhead" with its lack of true logic, horrifying visuals, and avant garde approach. However, "Eraserhead" actually has more of a plot than this film (if you can imagine that), while "The Alphabet" is simply just a collection of images (a lot of them made with animation), and what truly nightmarish images they are!
The Alphabet is in many ways what you would expect if you put a Sesame Street-short, a Terry Gilliam animation and a Japanese horror film in a blender. What is interesting is that all of these came after this short. This is a truth with modifications though, as Gilliam was making animations before Monty Python's Flying Circus, and educational shorts existed before Sesame Street - but it's still interesting to see how "timely" this short is.The short itself seems to touch upon themes of indoctrination, how knowledge and world views are forced from one generation to the next. Here, the knowledge is represented by the alphabet - maybe the first thing we (formally) teach our children. It's an OK approach to the subject matter, but not the reason why this short is interesting today. Instead, it's a look on a director developing his talents, exploring sound design and animation.If you ended up looking through this short's reviews, you've either seen it, or you are curious about it. If the latter: Check it out! It's short enough to either way be worth the experience.
I'm making my way through all of Lynch's films so I figured I'd start with his early short films and I am very pleased with them. I really liked Six Men Getting Sick and this one was great too. I will be commenting on the rest of them as well. The Alphabet is very ambiguous and let's you come up with your explanation of what's going on and I think that is great. David Lynch is a genius in so many ways. I think it's wonderful seeing where my favorite filmmaker started out and very inspiring. I am still trying to figure how he pulled some of the stuff in this film off and wondering how I could do something like this myself. I will continue to enjoy Lynch and be amazed by his work. I hope you can as well!
This short lays the groundwork for themes that Lynch has explored in many of his later films including those of a trapped child and monster parents. This short really is like watching a captured nightmare, and I mean that in a good way.
One of the most disturbing things i've ever seen. The actors in this film, David Lynch's third film technically, but his first narrative film, were never in any other movies - one of them, Father, died a few years ago - it is as if they exist only in the frightening nightmare world of this boy's life, which consists of two dog-like parents who only bark at him with unintelligible sounds, and beat him and rub his face in the urine when he wets the bed, like a puppy. The subject of the film (and if i don't tell you this, it'll make so little sense to you, because its never properly explained in the film) is the boy has no love from his parents, and no grandmother to give him respite from them and comfort him, so he grows one in the attic.It is a horrifying, brilliant film, which creates an imaginative world very successfully - albeit one you desparately want to escape from as soon as possible, but it does this well at least.The Lynchian oeuvre is almost fully formed here, right from the start. Little dialogue, atmospheric soundtrack of constant sound effects which you find in Eraserhead, Elephant Man, Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr; impressionistic approach to performance and makeup/costume and sets; the quality of estrangement in the direction, and most importantly there is the union of terrible, twisted darkness and optimistic naivety (developed to the full in Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr).For Lynch fans, this is a thing to see. Unlike Six Men Getting Sick or The Amputee, this is not just an experiment or an early film of a Director that ruins your impression of them, it stands on its own, irrespective of Lynch's subsequent work (though it also sets the tone for his subsequent narrative work) as a great surrealist/impressionist narrative short.
Long-time Lynch collaborator Jack Nance once said that watching The Grandmother was like spending half an hour in the electric chair. Mixing live action (both colour and black & white) with animation, along with a dark & unsettling soundscape created by Alan Splet (still Lynch's sound designer today, three decades later), the film is an intensely disturbing experience.The Grandmother deals with the story of a boy, abused by his brutal, animal-like parents, who grows himself a kindly grandmother in the attic.
Although it does suffer from a certain 'student film' feeling, this half-hour short is a must-see for all fans of David Lynch, particularly those who admire the stark & surreal world of Eraserhead. One can definitely see the genesis of Lynch's next film within it.
"The Grandmother" has got to be one of the strangest works of David Lynch next to "Eraserhead". In order to get the film made, Lynch got a grant from the American Film Institute. Too bad AFI doesn't fund amazing films like this anymore. In some aspects the film looks like it had a huge influence on "Begotten" (1991), except "The Grandmother" is only about 34 minutes and never wears out it's welcome. The story concerns a boy, who has very mean and abusive parents. They act like animals and only talk in barks. The little boy is very pale and Gothic looking, and almost all the film's sets are painted pitch black in darkness. This causes images to pop right out. The boy plants seeds in his bed, a huge abstract stump like object grows and gives birth to an old lady. The old lady seems to give the boy peace of mind, like a grandmother would. It's really hard to tell the exact story, since the film feels like a surreal nightmare that leaves the viewer disoriented. The music and experimental sound mix sounded way ahead of 1970. This only added more impact to it's disturbing imagery. Not to mention, it had some weird animated scenes too. From all the movies I've seen, I'd have to say the best examples of surrealism in film have to be Bunuel and Dali's "Un Chien Andalou", Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain" (1973) and David Lynch's "The Grandmother". All three of these films have images that will probably haunt you for the rest of your life.
Sick, disturbing and surreal short from David Lynch. A man and a woman get married and have a son who they don't really want. The child grows up being horribly abused by his parents. Then, in a dark sinister room, he plants a seed who sprouts into a grandmother. She, in a way, shows him the affection his parents never gave him. There's more but I won't spoil it.The film mixes live actors with animation seamlessly. It has sound but no dialogue--the actors just make sounds somewhat like human speech. It's in washed-out color which certainly fits the subject matter. Also you see Lynch using odd noises on the soundtrack which he perfected years later with "Eraserhead". I'm giving this film a 10 but it is VERY disturbing. It's definitely not for everybody. The abuse scenes are horrible to watch and the nonstop morbidness did start to wear on me, but I couldn't stop watching. It all leads to a very sad ending. Sick, troubling and (at times) horrifying movie but just incredible. A 10 but only for those who can stand extreme subject matter.
Let me start by saying that I'm certainly not the greatest David Lynch fan under the sun, especially not when it comes to his very early short films, so my expectations weren't too high to begin with. In the end, it was pretty much what I expected. As weird and surreal as always, with a couple good scenes, but as a whole rather underwhelming. It's Lynch's third film and definitely far superior at least to his first about several men getting sick. The story has some heart when a boy who gets abused verbally and physically by his parents plants a seed that grows into a caring grandmother, who smiles at the little one and gives him the emotional security he's been looking for.Occasionally it's an interesting mix of live action and animation and I liked the contrast between the B&W-scenes and the several shades of red, mostly related to blood. It started dragging a bit near the 25-minute mark, so I'm not sure the quite long running time was justified for the script, but I can't deny that some factors made it interesting again by adding general weirdness like the decent make-up work or the music, especially the song "You are my best friend." Nonetheless, while it's probably a feast for Lynch lovers, for me it was okay at best and certainly not eye-opening to his work.
David Lynch's The Grandmother is a 34-minute-long experimental nightmare. The absurdly dark, ominous visuals suggest the film is set inside a madman's nightmare, though it actually refers to the nuclear American family gone horribly wrong. Dialogue-free except for primal grunting and barking, The Grandmother is carried solely through dramatic acting and striking visuals. The soundtrack is cramped with white noise such as discordant grating, creaking and droning that compliments the already disturbing atmosphere. Lynch mixes hand-drawn animation with live-action in an effort to create a world as disturbing as it is surreal. The film's four characters remain nameless, appearing to be generic symbols.The Boy, whom the narrative centers on, is neglected and abused by his parents who treat him like an unwanted nuisance. They literally bark, growl, and crawl on all fours, symbolizing their distance from being human. All of the actors are caked with white powder makeup that causes their skin to glow brightly amidst the ultra-high contrast photography. The Boy's only attire is a black tuxedo with a bow tie, which combined with his solemn, pain-stricken face suggests he is attending an eternal funeral. Perhaps the Boy is dressed for his own funeral, because his life appears to be 'dead' on a symbolic level. The Father always wears a stained, moth-eaten white undershirt with equally dreadful boxer shorts. The photography is so high contrast that you often only see the Boy's stark white face and hands 'floating' around the pitch black background. On the opposite spectrum, the Father's bright clothes appear to jump out of the darkness, making his presence dominant and obvious. Despite the abstractness of The Grandmother, several themes appear evident. The Boy expresses the loneliness and pain that accompanies a household with abusive and neglectful parents. The Grandmother character, who the Boy secretly grows from a plant-like seed in the attic, symbolizes warmth and comfort. The Boy both figuratively and literally 'grows' a parental figure, comparing the growth of love to that of a plant. The Boy's actions suggest that love should be treated like growing a plant: you first plant the seed, then nurture it until it matures into something full and complete.After much attention and care, the Boy's plant grows into a massive, pulsating cocoon out of which the Grandmother crawls from, fully clothed and aged. The Boy and Grandmother immediately embrace and offer each other much-needed comfort. His world seems brighter for the time being, but his living nightmare is far from over. Ultimately, nothing lasts forever, as this film appears to suggest.The Grandmother is highly recommended for fans of the avant-garde, or anyone looking for something different. If you thought Eraserhead was Lynch's darkest and weirdest film, wait until you see this small miracle.
No matter how cynical you make think this film is, it is very realistic in what our world looks like as children. Dysfunctional families are all around us and we experience neglect very often. A child's point of view of course, is always exaggerated. I can relate to some of what is shown in "The Grandmother." Throughout my childhood my grandmother was the only person i could turn to. My parents talk, and their life during my childhood was very blurred to me. And the horrifying things that happen are more horrifying than they really are as a child. Lynch may have imaged this film out of nowhere, but it still speaks. The use of sound, and animation is powerfully effective. This is a must for Lynch fans!
The Grandmother, like other surreal short films (and, of course, like the rest of Lynch's work), is not that concerned with logic, at least in conventional terms. If there is anything at all conventional about the the film is that it has at its core that small statement on youth and innocence that can be interpreted a hundred ways to Sunday- if you're lonely and dejected you'll look for companionship. It's just that in this case the conventional wisdom of finding someone at the playground or at school is bypassed- here the boy, in isolation from his barking, mad parents, plants and grows a grandmother to spend time with. But is it all as it should be? Lynch, much as he did with Eraserhead, leaves so much up to interpretation that on a first viewing it's almost not even necessary to find something coherent in what goes on. But in that sense, of course, many will likely be befuddled, disturbed, and maybe even offended at the lack of typical cohesion from start to finish.What it does provide, however, is a kind of cinema experience that has to be felt, seen, heard, taken in as cinema on the technical and artistic side of things always goes. Even when I didn't know what was "going on" with the boy and his grandmother and parents, I didn't mind as long as I knew Lynch was doing something with the camera or lighting or editing or music or animation or all of the above to make it a visceral experience. Yes, there are some tedious moments here and there (which, even in being a 35 minute short film, are possibly more so than the ones in Eraserhead), yes the first two to three minutes takes some time to adjust to, and yes there ending is left about as ambiguous as can be. But it shook me up all the same, like the best parts of 90's music videos. Any time, for example, that Lynch used a sort of stop-motion technique during the live action I was thrilled in a way. The animated sequences have a crude quality that could only be matched by Gilliam's Python animations. And the actors (or maybe just pieces) in Lynch's macabre framing and set ups and pay off seem all perfect for the parts.If you're already a fan coming on to this DVD set of Lynch short films, this may or may not come as the most eccentric, wonderfully outrageous of the lot of them; it could also be for some the most 'huh' of all of the films as it is the longest and with the most density in the surrealism. It is the mark, interested in it or not, of an artist leaving something out for a good look and soak into what it is or could be or is lacking. Grade: A
After the promise shown in The Alphabet, David Lynch directed this half-hour feature which expanded upon the tones and aesthetics found in that short film. In many ways The Grandmother is a precursor to Eraserhead. Like the latter it's a surrealistic nightmare about dysfunctional people. A young boy is terrorised by his parents. They abuse him for his chronic bed-wetting. So he plants a seed in a pile of dirt in a room upstairs in his house. This in turn grows into a huge plant that gives birth to an older woman; the grandmother. She forms a loving bond with the boy, giving him the companionship he craves.The film combines live action with animation as did The Alphabet. Except now the live action is more predominant. The content of the film is unashamedly and consistently surreal and is an early showcase for Lynch's bizarre ideas. Both visually and aurally the film is very off-kilter. All the characters have white-painted faces, which stand out in a disconcerting way due to the high-contrast photography and black backgrounds. The strange imagery is complimented by an odd soundtrack where the characters talk in animal-like noises. The parents are so alien to the boy that they literally bark at him.Like Lynch's other work this is a film that combines the disturbing with the beautiful. Often at the same time. The story isn't really the point here. This is all about mood and atmosphere. It's an essential see for David Lynch fans and an excellent short film.
Okay. Basically I have only one major thematic element I can really comment on.In this short, Lynch seems to be particularly keen on dehumanizing humanity in every sense of the word. First, they characters are grown as plants, and they germinate (?) children rather than birth them. Then they're animals, both in personality and actions. Beyond just barking and snuffling and whining like dogs (Matt! Matt! Matt!), the way they treat each other is very abusive and inhuman.So then what's this whole thing about the grandmother? Is she supposed to be more human because of the love she shares with Matt? That's the reading that's readily apparent, but it doesn't really work out like that. If she was human, why is she a teakettle? Why does she birth, literally, from a tree? The short goes to levels that are hard to really comprehend.Which is fine. Fully comprehending a Lynch film isn't really the point.However, I would like to mention that this short has some of the strongest imagery, in a sense, of Lynch's career. The shots especially of the staircase just scream art even though they really aren't that particularly stylistic as compared to a lot of what else he's done. This is a much more aesthetically intriguing world, this short.--PolarisDiB
Before directing his breakthrough cult classic 'Eraserhead' David Lynch made this thirty-minute art school oddity, sketching on a smaller canvas the same nightmares that would later haunt his feature films. Using a raw, experimental style combining exaggerated live action with naive animation, Lynch flaunts his preoccupation with psychosexual imagery and symbolism, showing all the creative freedom (and many of the pretensions) of an artist discovering his true medium. Yes, the film does have a plot, but it's not really about a boy and his grandmother, any more than 'Eraserhead' was about a man and his baby. Shown on the same program (when I saw it, at the Red Vic Theatre on Haight Street in San Francisco) was the eight-minute animated 'Alphabet', another early Lynch project, and definitely not the sort of pre-school primer taught on Sesame Street. Viewers familiar with his more recent work will know exactly what to expect.
This is a very odd, and rather disturbing short. If you're not into Lynch then give it a wide birth, even if you are, then approach with caution. The story concerns itself with an unhappy boy who grows a grandmother. Well, that's all I could work out anyway. The rest of the film is filled with bed wetting, barking parents, and bizarre animations. Everything is in disturbingly garish colours (generally deep blue), and there isn't a single line of dialogue. See this if you're a die-hard Lynch fan or if you're a budding experimental film maker. If, however, you found Eraserhead too weird then steer well clear.
This film is a must-see for anyone interested in the world of surreal cinema. Combines fascinating visual metaphor with rich, vivid animation to create a disturbing ambience that draws the viewer in, like a fish caught on a hook. The music (provided by a collective of music engineers known as "Tractor") is like a grey canopy that wraps itself over your mind as you find that time and space and your life outside of a cold, flickering living room seem to fade into this backdrop of radioactive multimedia. Make no mistake about it, Lynch is an artist of the highest calibur, and in this gripping work he uses everything in the film as a medium to transmit his imagination to the outside world.P.S. - If you like Lynch's style, I suggest looking into the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky, Luis Bunuel & Jean Cocteau. All of them brilliant artists in their medium.
I don't know if I was bored by this film because it isn't very good or because the images were stolen by later films. This film reminds me of other films like Forbidden Zone, Begotten and Lynch's own Eraserhead, all of which play better than this story of a boy who grows a Grandmother.How do you really critique the film? I've seen it before isn't fair especially when this might be the source of what I saw before. It would be like disliking Citizen Kane because it isn't revolutionary in modern eyes.Try it. It can't hurt. The only thing you really have to lose is 34 minutes of your life, certainly seeing this is better than watching yet another Seinfeld episode.
This film is a lesson. A lesson on how you can, with minor means,create a work which explores all ways of cinematography. And thiswithout any dialogue. In my idea films are not there to tell a story(they can be used as such tough) and this movie goes straightback to the time where films were shown at carnivals and gave youa glimpse of new worlds to be explored. Don't worry too much about the (lack of) narritive story. Just sit backand enjoy the huge amount of emotions that will come to you.Fear, hatred, love and desire for a better world.
David Lynch brings us an unsettling vision of a bed-wetting boy, his abusive parents, and the grandmother that he grows from a seed. The film, which toggles between live action and animation (reminiscent of Terry Gilliam), is dark, organic and surreal, especially when the 'grandmother seed' germinates into a spiky, phallic mushroom, growing from a pile of dirt centered on an old-fashioned bed. Reversing normal progression, the grandmother is pulled from the womb, fully dressed, by the child, who then engages in revenge fantasies against his parents following an incredibly unappetizing dinner scene. Best watched at night, in the dark for full effect, "The Grandmother" is a series of strange, and sometimes unpleasant, images strung together by the barest of stories. Not for all tastes but a must for fans of Lynch or of experimental filmmaking in general. My ranking is based on neither really liking nor really disliking the film, but probably not really 'getting it' either. Maybe you will...
David Lynch films can be very weird, that's for sure. I've seen "Eraserhead" (all of it), so I have a strong stomach and a stick-with-it attitude towards films...but "The Grandmother", even for Lynch, is a weird little film that would challenge most normal folks to finish it! And yet, like so many of Lynch's films, his fans swear it's brilliant from start to finish...and the film has many reviews which give it 8, 9 or 10. All I know is that for the normals out there (the non-Lynch fans), there is almost no way you'll finish this short nor enjoy it.The story is told using strangely made up folks with chalky white makeup. They don't talk but make guttural sounds from time to time. And so, apart from sound effects and some weird music, it's essentially a silent film. There also are some cartoon portions that really baffle the viewer. Because of this, what exactly is happening is really up to the individual to interpret or assume.There is a boy who lives with abusive parents. He is naturally sad and deals with it the way any kid would....he pours dirt all over a bed and plants a grandmother seed. It grows and grows until ultimately the giant pod-like thing gives birth to a grandma...and the kid seems very happy to have someone to love him. What's next....well, find out for yourself.
I tried very hard but ultimately hated this short film that was shown on Turner Classic Movies. Perhaps you'll like it, but I assure you that unless you are really into avante garde and mind-warping cinema, you'll find it tough going. A real chore to watch...and 33 minutes sure felt like 70!
The best David Lynch short I've seen so far is definitely The Grandmother and I am blown away. Each one I see gets better and I still have a few to go. Hopefully that pattern continues. The Grandmother is so extremely well done and so beautiful and it was with a grant and an 8 page script. It's things like this that really makes me think that I might be able to make a real film someday. The feel of this movie is so unique and creepy. I love how Lynch lets us know exactly who his characters are without them saying a single word. This film is definitely a great example of that and of how anyone can do what they set out to do. See this right now if you like David Lynch!
David Lynch,who started out as a painter,moved into conceptual art,then moved into film,first with a piece that involved six animated heads vomiting something like six times (Six Figures Getting Sick). He then moved on to his first short film,'Alphabet',some time later. In 1970,he directed his second short film,'The Grandmother'. To call this film short surreal would be like calling the Grand Canyon vast. 'Grandmother' told the tale of a young boy (played by Richard White,who is just credited as "The boy"),who has to deal with two of the most dysfunctional parents (Virginia Maitland & Robert Chadwick),who crawl around on all fours,bark & whine like a pair of dogs,and make the boy's existence sheer hell. The boy figures there must be something better out there,and from a seed found in a bag marked "seeds" plants the biggest one,from which a kind of spiny vegetation sprouts. When the vegetation/plant gives birth to a full term,adult grandmother (Dorthy McGinnis),the boy now has some kind of link to parental love. David Lynch,in addition to writing & directing this bizarre,dreamy (and occasionally nightmarish),surreal film,also photographs,edits,creates stop motion animation & has a hand in the sound design (with Alan Splet,who also worked with Lynch on Eraserhead). Not widely screened,but well worth seeking out for fans of experimental/avant garde/midnight cult films (it was shot in 16mm,which would somewhat limit it's distribution to cinemas that are equipped for films of that nature). Not rated by the MPAA,but does have some rather unsettling,if not outright disturbing sequences that would give some young 'uns some screwed up nightmares.
Just recently saw this film along with "The Alphabet"...One of the most disconcerting Lynch films I've ever seen...but incredibly brilliant...the portrayal of the animalistic sides of the human psyche, and the "touching of the grandmother" scenes are quite unique...overall, I highly recommend this short film for anyone interested in film as an art.  Extra kudo's to those who see the psychological metaphors throughout the film.
Any single second of this film's cinematography is immediately recognizable as the work of the creative mind of David Lynch.It is like watching a nightmare: odd, disturbing, pointless. It is ostensibly about an abused child who grows a grandmother so he can have a comfortingpresence in his dysfunctional family. The entire 33 minutes is an exercise in visual and aural ugliness. Everyone is in white makeup; the boy is formally dressed resembling Emcee in Cabaret. When the family sits down to eat, plastic bags of bread are strewn on the table, an unlit electric lamp takes up most of the tablespace (candles may have looked too pretty). Any furniture visible in the stark high contrast cinematography is thrift-store trash.
Although it has sound, it is mostly atonal noise and shrieks. Although it is a live-action film, there is animation (more ugliness); although it is in black and white, there are colors, the most pronounced being dark yellow urine stains. (This poor kid must need a urologist.) Urine in this movie is about as profuse as blood is in The Shining.The grandmother who grows quickly out of a bulb, smiles sometimes, but since that is about it for her as a contrast to the shouting monosyllabic parents, she isn't that much of a comfort. She mostly lies in her bed of dirt--but isn't that the same bed the boy wets all the time? Oh, well, dreams don't have to make sense.The surreal look is peppered with stop-motion cinematography, so Lynchian. But it is only "enjoyable" as an example of his style. This is to be seen by film-students, not audiences seeking escapism. The reaction is meant to be less "Hooray for Hollywood" and more "WTF!"
"The Grandmother" and "Eraserhead" are Lynch's seminal films, and they also both make a perfect pairing for a multitude of reasons. Both are cryptic portraits of a tragic central character, both are wildly surreal and abstract, and both tell a clear story through strange imagery and symbolism as opposed to any methods conventional to narrative filmmaking. It isn't until you are able to decode the many metaphors (which, in "The Grandmother" specifically, is a rather easy task if you pay attention) before you realize how truly sad these stories are. Watching it for a second time, "The Grandmother" comes across as less of a horror film and more as a tragedy. Don't get me wrong, it has horror elements and is genuinely scary in parts, but overall the atmosphere is one of dark fantasy and downbeat drama. The film foreshadows Lynch's following works in a few ways. It covers many of the themes Lynch has explored throughout his career, most notably the dysfunctional family, a fear of human sexuality, bizarre reproduction-type scenes, tragic and outsider protagonists, etc. Tonally, it is also your typical Lynch affair, with tons of surrealist imagery, a creepy and discomforting atmosphere, (in this case, unfortunately minimal) black comedy, absurdist visuals, enigmatic characters, a perplexing, nonlinear structure, and plenty more that fail to come to mind right now. If you're a David Lynch fan, this is an essential viewing, and if you haven't yet seen a Lynch film, or have seen very few of them, then I would definitely recommend you view this short as soon as possible (I'm pretty sure it's available in rather high quality on YouTube, and it is also an extra on Criterion's great "Eraserhead" release on DVD and Blue- ray), because I think that it (along with "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet", and maybe a few other early Lynch shorts) is a fantastic introduction to his work. It embodies many of the elements that make him great and acclaimed worldwide, and perfectly presents his overall mood and style in a brief, haunting, and masterful way.
The Grandmother is a good companion piece to Eraserhead (I remember when they used to show this on a double bill with Alphabet).  Robert Chadwick as the dog/father looks much younger than his actual age.  The boundaries broken with the boy in this film are very disturbing.  And it is heartbreaking to see a child have to "grow" a comforting parental figure. Great film.
I saw this very late one night when I was about 12 years old...I couldn't sleep so I watched this and it was so creepy I still couldn't sleep once it had finished! They say the boy is Lynch and his childhood experiences. To me, his Grandmother represented the love and security he craved and needed. Although she comforts him, her comfort is at times suffocating. I particularly remember that her huge chest smothers him and part of him hates her and fears her. He secretly hopes for her death and keeps putting mirrors over her face whilst she sleeps to check if she is still breathing. I'd recommend this to all Lynch fans and anyone who wants to see a sinister film which has little if no dialogue, no colour, no pure narrative, just mood, art and plenty of Lynch genius. I can't recall how it ends but having not seen the film for over 16 years I think that's fair enough. I would like to see it again though, if anyone knows how I can get hold of it..?
A dejected little boy (an effective performance by Richard White) who suffers at the hands of his monstrously abusive parents (portrayed with startling ferocity by Robert Chadwick and Virginia Maitland) plants some weird seeds in order to grow himself a caring and nurturing grandmother (sweetly played by Dorothy McGinnis).Naturally, this spooky and unsettling early short by David Lynch doesn't have much in the way of a coherent story (the whole thing unfolds like a child's bad dream complete with evil adults who bark like dogs and even crawl around on all fours), but nonetheless still makes a strong impression due to its surreal brooding atmosphere, striking wealth of bizarre visuals, inspired use of jarring sound effects that really add to the overall nightmarish mood, occasional bits of funky stylized animation, and the way the narrative works as a loopy meditation on birth, life, and death with a poignant central point on the basic human need to feel loved and accepted. Worth a watch for fans of challenging outre fare.
While at the American Film Institute, David Lynch tested two different types of videotape stock by shooting this strange little piece, featuring Catherine Coulson as an amputee writing a letter, & Lynch as a nurse attending her. Coulson's voiceover details various domestic issues, & she remains oblivious to the fact that she might be bleeding to death while the nurse rushes around frantically, eventually, it seems, abandoning her.It has been suggested that Lynch deliberately shot both versions badly, so that the Institute wouldn't start replacing film with videotape.Regardless of whether or not this is true, The Amputee is better viewed as an example of Lynch's warped sense of humour than his skill as a filmmaker, & of what sort of ideas he might come up with for something as simple as a stock test.
Amputee, The (1974) Version 1 *** (out of 4) Amputee, The (1974) Version 2 ** 1/2 (out of 4)David Lynch's fourth film has a woman (Catherine E. Coulson) with no legs writing a letter to a lover while a nurse (Lynch) does weird things to her stumps. It should come as no shock but here's another very strange film from the director. It's weird because while your ears are listening to what the woman has to say, your eyes never leave her stumps where all sorts of weird things are going on. I'm sure this short will offend many people and it's this offensiveness that makes the film so effective. The goo coming from her stump has to be seen. The second version runs a minute shorter and doesn't appear to have as much being done to her stumps.
David Lynch made this short during a troubled time when filming of Eraserhead had come to a stand-still due to lack of funds. He volunteered to make a short film twice as a test for a couple of stocks of black and white videotape that the American Film Institute wished to compare. As a result he made a film called The Amputee twice. Both versions are more or less the same and consist of a woman who is a double-amputee reading aloud to herself the contents of a letter that she has written while a doctor tends one of the stumps on her legs. It ends with the stump gushing blood, the doctor fleeing and the woman completely oblivious.In truth it isn't very interesting. It's shot in one take with ugly composition. The quality of the videotape is poor in both versions; while the content is a combination of the repulsive with the mundane. It was written and filmed over the course of one day, and it is throwaway stuff that is of limited interest. It's more an example of the director's bizarre humour than anything else. It stars Catherine Coulson who would go on to play the part of The Log Lady in Twin Peaks.
While David Lynch's films tend to gross you out through their art, this seemed to be made just to gross out.  If the woman was saying something in her letter, it gets lost in the first viewing and this is not something I'd like to see a second time.  Albeit, there are two versions of this on the DVD.  The second, shorter version looks like it has more goop shooting out, though the quality makes it hard to tell.
While it is not as deep or impressive as some of Lynch's other works, I believe that this film breaks new ground in terms of camera work and how a scene is put together. I think it is important that this film is shot twice, once to capture the story, the other to capture what is happening. If you view simply the woman, you will grasp what her letter is all about, however, if you view the nurse, you will take in only what the nurse is doing. Viewing it once just staring at the woman, and then again viewing only the nurse gives quite a contrasting look at the same exact picture. It may very well be an experiment only, but the fact that it has this effect is intriguing on its own. Try it yourself!
Maybe the lesser of the bunch of David Lynch shorts I've seen, the only real interest are in some seconds here and there within the four minute un-broken shot of some nasty, black-death humor that's ingrained into the material. Unfortunately, it's almost a waste to watch the film as it is by admission of Lynch himself a technical 'throaway', something to just get onto film to bite back at the AFI for possibly switching to video. Therefore we get what could be comparable to what Godard did around the same time- tool around with the possibilities of video by just going for something off-putting within the frame. It could've worked maybe as something worth watching more, but it's really a bit too un-pleasant even in its own biting sense-of-what-the-hell way. It's just an amputee who writes a confessional letter (heard in voice-over) as a wacko doctor plugs away at one of her stumps. He also, at the end, just runs away in a hurry, perhaps as to just add that last bit of "whoa" for Lynch to work with. That part is actually a nice bit of surreal whimsy, but the work is just too simplistic and deranged to really give any sense of visual amazement like in the other shot works of Lynch, or to build on the outrageousness like in Eraserhead. Worth a watch, once, then never again unless you have a thing for, well, stumps, and confessional letters written during their upheaval.
If you enjoy being disgusted (as I do), then you will love this.  It is challenging to really make your audience want to gag (as I heard John Waters say once), and Lynch does it very well here.  The 5 minutes consists of an amputee getting her wounds cleaned and it is not pleasant.  Enjoy!  8/10
David Lynch wrote this short film to test two different types of videotape stock for the American Film Institute. You can check this out in "The Short films of David Lynch". I found this short extremely intelligent. In "The Short films of David Lynch" it is shown twice, but is not the same action, only the text is the same. For me, in the first time I just couldn't stop staring at the nurse, who is in the only place on screen where action is happening. The second time, what she is is "thinking" gets more relevant to the audience, but we find out that it has no connection at all to her legs and to the nurse. In the end I figured out that I had just watched two different short movies! It's a great feeling for those who like the art of making movies!
This is a black-and-white short film by director David Lynch from the 1970s. He was still in his 20s when he shot this one. Basically for the entire 9 minutes, we watch a woman sitting on an armchair. The camera is static and the woman has stumps instead of legs, must have been in a terrible accident. The woman (played by Catherine E. Coulson, long-time collaborator with Lynch) keeps telling random stories about people we do not know, while a nurse (played by Lynch himself) is busy with taking care of the lady's stumps. I am fairly certain that this film would not be famous if it wasn't for its director. It's really very uninteresting and I cannot come up with a similar reason why you would want to watch this. Maybe the static camera is supposed to let us feel the woman's situation as she cannot move either. I have no idea. But I certainly do not recommend this one. Entirely forgettable.
For the non-intuitive, the film is just a grotesque, confusing image but think of it again. A woman in an absolutely pitiful state (blood and puss spewing out of her stump) is lost in her thoughts and memories of Love and Romance! It's just a simple ironic image with no plot, back story or message. How one can entirely neglect the present no matter how rotten it is and choose to dwell in the past. So lost! So Engrossed!The film was made for the sole purpose of helping the American Film Institute decide between two stocks of black and white film. David Lynch, soon to emerge as one of the greatest directors ever proposed to shoot a short film twice. One can imagine David Lynch getting excited on the thought of the imagery he was to put to film "An amputated woman in an extremely deteriorated state lost in the days of her romantic endeavors!"I understand that only a handful of people would appreciate the concept, leaving the majority confused and disgusted but The Amputee is a simple masterpiece open to interpretation
I understand that this was shot by David Lynch to test two different kinds of film. However, there's really nothing to it other than that. It's just an amputated woman writing a letter to someone, and later getting operated on. It's one continuous shot and nothing else happens at all. There is a cool effect with blood at one point that I did enjoy, but I think that's all that I really liked about it. It's just boring I guess you could say, and as a David lynch junkie, I was certainly let down. But it's all relative I suppose, I a lot of people have enjoyed it so you may also. After all, anything from the best living director is worth seeing!
It's obviously meant to look kinda shabby, and there's no evidence of any rehearsal. So with those parameters in mind, it's really great. I kept thinking how ridiculous, how juvenile, but I couldn't look away. I somehow knew it wasn't going anywhere, and I also felt it didn't have to; it's horrible stupidity is so fun. Nonsense is so underrated, so easily dismissed, but this simple, freaky clip haunts me. It harasses the psyche, the way early Monty Python or The Aqua Teen Hunger Force infects my consciousness.Even though it's just meant to stretch a few creative tendons, it still pulses with the same absurd wide eyed wondrous horror of his more ambitious stuff. The sentimentally mundane and tedious narration that's totally at odds with the ridiculously disturbing visual creates exactly that type of extreme discomfort that has been the defining quality of all his best work. He produces this same detached, dizzying horror with Nikki's death scene in "INLAND EMPIRE" where two street dwellers are calmly discussing a possible bus route to Pamona, unconcerned as Laura Dern's Nikki lays bleeding between them right on Hollywood Boulevard. Nothing is ever just what it seems in a Lynch moment.
I for one thought both the first version and second version to be hysterically funny! David Lynch changed a small bit of this short film to test two different types of film, but in the end the second film looked like it had a better touch up quality. David's cameo fit the perfect role as the nurse and in the second film ended up to be a laugh when he ran out of the room because of her oozing bloody foot wound. The story didn't make much sense to me, only that i knew she had some disputes with some initial friends or acquaintances, but i for sure thought it was a dark comedy in a way.David Lynch is, by far, an amazing writer towards shorts;Even know he uses the most complex and confusing ways to make his shorts and films so original that it almost can't be interpreted. Without one doubt i'm a firm believer that this short was better then both "The Alphabet" and " Absurd Encounter with Fear", combined. The question is what was the girl talking about? and how did she get like this? There will be no prequel, but it is a question that only your mind could answer, once again the imagination of David Lynch.
Since this was more of an experiment without direction of form, only an experiment of video stock, I'd have to say that it's unsuccessful: the video quality is poor and doesn't add anything to the overall action of the scene being presented.That said, the scene being presented is kind of interesting. A double-amputee writes a letter to someone else, talking about recent drama and a love-triangle while some random doctor character screws up and sends her leg bleeding all over the place. The end.It's shot twice (two different video stocks), and while the first is better paced, the second has more action (read: blood). The first feels more intricately designed, what with the voice-over narration, the woman writing, and the doctor operating and all of it concluding at the same time. The second one isn't quite so well-tuned, even in keeping everything together (some blood spills over the page the woman is writing on, which cuts away the sense of odd surreality and just makes it kind of ridiculous), but there's a lot more stuff going on and it's slightly more impactive... too bad it's ended awkwardly.--PolarisDiB
Hmm. Another weirdo early David Lynch short film has a woman with a double leg amputation writing a letter (which she narrate in voice over) as a hospital attendant, played by Lynch, attends to her stumps. Weird and not all that interesting or insightful. Lynch was asked to make a film by the American Film Institute to test two new black and white video tape stocks and this was the result. Fredrick Elms photographed the short. One and a half stars for sheet stomach turning weirdness.
If you like early Lynch, you may like this. A commentary, I think, on amputation not only of the physical variety, but of the emotional as well. At five minutes long, sitting through the film is not exactly the test of patience a film like "Lost Highway" or "Eraserhead" may be... but in terms of its content, it is decidedly just as experimental as either of those.
I can think of very few films that have sound as their most commendable feature. The Exorcist is one, a film that, aside from infrequent strains of `Tubular Bells', adopts minimal incidental music. This is laudable in a horror genre where shocks are clearly signposted  and predicted  by overgenerous musical stings. The Exorcist may be flawed, but its avoidance of this field cliché is worthy of praise.Eraserhead is the other film that excels in sound. A frankly disturbing concoction of industrial score and white noise with undercurrents of musical hall and sonorous church organ, it is almost an extra character in the film, and easily it's most prominent factor. Yet Eraserhead is to be recommended for more than its incidentals. An impenetrable and gloomy work, what is it actually about? Who is the credited `man in the planet' who pulls levers that control giant spermatozoa? Many questions like this permeate a film which perhaps has to be seen several times to get over the initial shock of it's avant gardism. Lynch extracts the everyday and supplants it with the exceptionally bizarre. The experience of meeting a girlfriend's parents for the first time is never worse than here, where the parents in question gyrate spasmodically to the animated legs of a blood-spitting chicken. It's these scenes  along with the deformed mutant baby  that could lend the film the air of an abortion debate. Birth and repressed sexuality thrive throughout the film, from suckling puppies to the seductive appeal of the `beautiful girl across the hall' and a mother-in-law that gets too close for comfort. I guess the entire film could be a man's mental breakdown when faced with the premature responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood. Though to be honest I couldn't even begin to imagine what it's really all about.Encroaching blackness fills every scene, where lights are intermittent at best, and at worse fail completely. Often sets  particularly the bedroom when `Mary X' is feeding the child  are like prison cells. Two of the most eerie segments involve a title-explaining dream (?) where Henry's (Nance's) head is carved into pencil rubbers and an unsettling musical number from the `lady in the radiator'. This is the same lady with two candyfloss-like lumps on her cheeks that alternates her stage appearances between stamping on giant sperm to singing with religious convictions.Direction and cinematography are brilliant throughout, though the climax is the ultimate extension of a film that borders on darker, extremely unpleasant aspects of reality. I took a girl to see this film once, where the conclusion formed the final straw in what could be seen as a cycle of repellent imagery. I wonder why I never saw her again?
In film school it is not cool to say you like David Lynch. Film students claim he is just a poor mans version of Luis Bunuel. Yes, I would say that Bunuel is more talented and is the king of surrealism. But Lynch is very good and his films do challenge the viewer. I actually have a deep affection for his films. When his films work, they really work! However, when they do not work, for example, Twin Peaks, Fire, Walk with Me or Lost Highway then they quickly launch themselves into self parody. Many people claim his material is too inconsistent and indulgent to be really liked very much.  What I find strange is that one reviewer here states that he feel duped by Lynch. Duped? Why? The films all have a story. They just have a narrative that works differently to conventional film making. If you look hard at the film and try to understand the subtext then you will pick up  on what the film is about. I saw this when I was 16. I knew nothing about films or film making then. A friend and I were bored so we decided to see a movie at capitol cinema. Capitol cinema used to be a cinema that played arty or small independent films. They used to play midnight showings of eraserhead. There was always someone smoking a joint in that place. However, you don't need drugs for this film. Lynch is drugs. This film just buzzes you out.
 I had no idea what Eraserhead was about. I had never heard of Lynch and knew nothing about surrealism. I went in and was just totally blown away! Before this I had only really seen commercial blockbuster movies. Lynch gave me a whole knew perspective on what cinema is capable of. Eraserhead is the stuff of dreams. Lynch believes that watching a film is entering a dream state. Both my friend and I did not know what the hell was going on. I was fascinated...    Later I would learn this is a film about Lynch's own obsessions. His hatred of Philadelphia. His fear and anxiety at being a father. The film is just full of a kind of a compulsive, paranoid neurosis. It is a waking nightmare. He also seems to parody the nuclear family. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?' Meanwhile that weird blond woman in his radiator seems to represent his escape. A way to transcend from his grim world. What I also find bizarre is that people then accuse him of having no sense of humor! What? There are always funny moments in his films. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?'Jack Nance is also very good as the main character. He seems to be playing the director and he gives a performance that is distant, spaced out and yet emotionally vulnerable. A really strange mix. The imagery is just brilliant. Black and white in an industrial wasteland. There is smoke here of course. It wouid not be a Lynch film without smoke! It also has a cool, grating industrial soundtrack that sets your nerves on edge. This is perfectly effective for the bleak tone of the film. It is so visually striking that the viewer will not forget the imagery quickly. There is a reason that this is a cult film. The other distinctive feature of this film is the long lingering shots. This reminds me of Jim Jarmusch and his movies like Dead Man and Ghost Dog. The length of the shots seems to have the effect of immersing the viewer in this strange industrial wasteland.I have my own copy that I lend to friends. They then normally give it back to me saying that they only got through the first half hour. They also normally tell me that I am a weirdo for liking it. I think what frustrates people most about Lynch is that he will not give any explanations of what the film is about. So any interpretation is as good as any other. People want the film to be explained so they can understand it. Who said films must be understood or comprehensible? Why can't a film be abstract piece of art like a painting? Lynch's films are like an acid trip. To quote the great gonzo, Hunter S Thompson, 'buy the ticket, take the ride and if it gets a little heavier than what you  had in mind, then put it down to forced consciousness expansion.'  So in other words, relax, stick it on and just run with it. Travel into someone else's nightmare for a change...
I'm always a bit worried when I'm about to express my love towards this movie by the genius director David Lynch... I figure it's the perfect indicator for psychiatrists to claim that you're completely nuts :) But what the heck, they're a lot of nutballs on this website, so I can speak my mind freely. Indeed, I love this movie...although 'love' may be a wrong term to describe my feelings towards it. This movie 'fascinates' me is a much better saying. Usually, a movie is something in which you can live yourself in...in order to escape the stress of real life. Eraserhead is the exact opposite of that ! When watching this film, you can only hope that you'll never awake in the wold like Lynch shows it here. The horrible noises, the colorless and tasteless locations and the insensible characters...you all hate to love it. Eraserhead takes a walk with your emotions, you don't know whether to be disgusted or intrigued by it. So you'll feel uncomfortable when watching it and that's a wonderful experience for a cinema freak !Eraserhead is the ultimate cult film in my opinion and a must see for every fan of this delicious genre. In fact, I would go so far to say you can't call yourself a cult-freak if you haven't seen it yet.David Lynch begins his highly impressive career with this one and it still lives on. Eraserhead isn't his best film at all ( certainly not when it comes to storyline ) but it's his most deep and personal tale. 25 years old and still the "weirdest" film ever. That's an achievement, certainly with all this artistic filmmakers lately...or, at least, they try to be...)I want to encourage as much people as possible to see this one, but it's for the best that some groups of people avoid it. Surely not recommended if you're depressed or suicidal...The image of Jack Nance and the rest of the cast could even put you more down, I think. The tagline of this movie - "In heaven, everything looks fine" - could become a stimulus, I'm afraid. Pregnant women and young couples in love should beware as well !! This film is the ultimate nightmare for that what should be the greatest miracle of life...The hideous but yet harmless "baby" ( I really don't know how I should call it, actually )is the purest form of horror that ever occurred on the screen.You must have respect for director David Lynch. If you imagine how hard it must have been to create and finance this production. But it worked...hell, even comedy legend Mel Brooks was deeply impressed. Based on this film, he decided to let Lynch direct "The Elephant Man" a few years later. By that, David's career was launched and of course he made a masterpiece out of it. For me personally, his highlights were the 80's with terrific movies like "Blue Velvet", "Dune" ( very underrated, in my opinion) and "Wild at Heart" at the end of the decade. And let's not forget the best TV-series ever made: "Twin Peaks".Please, watch this movie !! Three times in a row if possible. I know a lot of people who just stopped watching it after half and hour ( or less ) and yelled "What the f*** is this ???". Real shame, if you ask me. It's an insight to a great mind and a unique event. If you really don't see the magic of it, at least try to admire the very stylish haircut of the main character. I'm thinking of doing the same thing with mine...
You need a clear head and focused intent prior to settling down to an abstract and uncoupled vision of a world that's so out of phase with anything you have or will ever come across - wlack & bhite but not monochrome.
A surprising number of reviewers here howl at length about how bored they were by this movie. No surprise. I doubt David Lynch intended to entertain the viewer of Eraserhead. He intended to invoke a response, to be sure, but amusement was not it. There is not a single word nor phrase I can use to convey the response this movie brought out in me. Fascinated depression, appalled sympathy, and an ever present feeling of gratitude that although I was present in this bleak, inhuman, industrial, possibly toxic world, it was just a dream and I would be away from it eventually, unlike Henry Nance.The events draw you along in morbid curiosity as Henry goes about his business, fate not being very kind to him at any particular point. The pacing is slow enough that one has time to muse on the meaning of what transpires while the dank grim surroundings press down on oneself as they do on Henry.Should be watched in the evening with darkened lights. It is a trip, if you are willing to take it.Those who are bored should not watch it. They should rent 'Rambo', or perhaps 'Smokey and the Bandit'.
How frightening. How unnerving. What a spectacular piece of film-making. I saw the film for the first time with a tiresome former colleague who kept turning to me and whispering : "Please exhale" "Are you breathing?" "Please breathe" or "Please stop breathing" I wanted to run away but I couldn't I was glued, stacked, hooked. The world of David Lynch is made of kindly horrors, normal monsters, poetic nightmares. I wonder what planet is he from. I think it would important to know so we can all avoid it. That's what any average Joe may say because every average Joe, me included, finds something familiar in this fascinating, peculiar, horrifying vision of the world. You want to close your eyes, but you can't. Even if you could, you still can hear. the whimpering of the thing, the child, the figment of David Lynch's imagination. How can you recommend a nightmare to a friend? Well you must, if friendship involves sharing every possible experience. "Earserhead" will put you to the test in a way no other film has ever done. Go! I dare you.
Although on some level I understand its cultural appeal inside the world of horror, Eraserhead seems to favor visuals and its creepy nature and absolutely nothing deeper. I have a great respect for director David Lynch, and I praise his artistic creativity and boldness while making this film. That being said, I feel Eraserhead is largely quite a mess. I enjoy the look of the film, the black and white cinematography feeling like a nice touch, but the film is simply too forcibly odd and surreal to be any true fun to watch. It feels like you are watching a fever dream unfold, and on some level I understand how that can be an interesting point of view, but I feel its largely too dull and too random to be any fun, and too forced to feel believable. The acting is fine, all the actors commit to their bizarrely written roles and strange dialogue/situations. The script is a mess, never deciding if it wants to be a metaphor for something, or simply a strange gag which I never really got. In the end, Eraserhead is by far one of the most bizarre films i've ever seen, and although I didn't enjoy it, and may not remember it, I admire its willingness to try something new- even though it doesn't succeed.
My Rating: 4/10
My experiences with David Lynch always leave me saying "What?" This is no exception. I have seen posters and pictures advertising this film for the thirty odd years it has been around. I always wondered about it. I finally had a chance to view it and found it to be the perfect representative of those weird anxiety dreams that all of us have. Start with a very strange young man who isn't half as strange as the rest of the characters. Throw in a marriage and the offspring of that marriage, a lizard who is quite ill. These people are trapped caring for this thing, not knowing exactly how it appeared or why. There those Pinter like pauses and odd statements made at the oddest times. There is no future that anyone can recognize; where are they going. There are scenes of people dancing and stepping on the heads of more snake-like creatures, cruel exchanges, a man's head being severed and made into pencil erasers. Does this sound like your typical film? And, yet, I couldn't take my eyes off it. I had lapsed into my own nightmare state, I guess. It is about as claustrophobic as anything I've ever seen. I wanted fresh air after seeing this.
I needed to read all the other reviews here before I was game to make a comment. I'm a great fan of Lynch's Wild at Heart having seen it four times, and recently loved Lost Highway. But this one left me baffled. I'd heard of it for years, but can make little sense of it. It certainly didn't bore me, in fact I was fascinated to see where the plot led. Tried to analyse it in terms of symbolism, but decided that if I have to do that the film isn't really speaking to me. The dark broodiness is impressive, the squishiness repulsive, and Henry's hairdo is unforgettable!
You have to dissect it, watch it more than once, eat, breathe it and live it before you can get it. There are lots of explanations for all of the things that "make no sense"... it's art in it's purest form - you take away from it what you want! You can see Henry struggling with suddenly being thrust into the role of father and husband, his sin, his temptation, his life, his death, his dreams... too much symbolism to even get into here... anyone who dismisses this film as "junk that makes no sense" will never get it, and that's OK. But for the rest of us, it's on our "Top Ten Films of All Time" list. Brilliant and beautiful and horrifying! Makes you think for weeks... YEARS. I love it. Highly recommended to those who are open-minded! AMAZING FILM!!
I sometimes dream of waking to a completely dark world, a world with no sunlight and minimal artificial light. My vision is blurred, but there is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty, and my friends and family are lifeless; sitting, standing or even walking, but with nothing to do or say, and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because there is nothing to learn, nothing is discussed because nothing is interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with, only partially aware that there is anything better.The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Henry Spencer, the main character in Eraserhead, who becomes father to a hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value, but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it. The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing I have ever seen. And although Henry seems to be devoid of any spark of personality, we can't help but sympathise with him throughout the film.Similar to my dream, the only form of light is artificial, the streets are virtually empty, and the only person in the entire film who has any personality is the father-in-law, and the only thing he has to talk about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any link to better times. ("I've watched this city turn from pastures to the hell-hole it is now.") The city they live in is completely industrialized, and the only plant life seen is dead, and in a pile of soil on Henry's bedside table.Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust, but nothing is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any of it means, and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the message board of Eraserhead before you see the film, as it is so much more powerful and chilling to experience it first-hand.The first time I saw Eraserhead, I was completely confused. It is possible that David Lynch just put a load of random imagery together and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all together and make their own sense of it (or not). On the other hand, there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very open-minded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.One viewing of Eraserhead is enough to raise about a dozen questions, and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely different set of theories, battling persistently against your previous conceptions, but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense in one interpretation, but fit in perfectly to another. You could probably watch Eraserhead several times, and each time see a slightly different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly what Eraserhead is about, you would get six different answers, each equally correct in their own right, and each equally confused.That being said, this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the first Lynch film I have seen, and it certainly won't be the last. But there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind tricks and special effects (for its time, anyway.) There will be those who don't like much to think about, and want it all explained bit by bit in perfect detail. Well, Eraserhead is an epitome of everything such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain: If your favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude, Where's My Car?', you probably won't get much out of Eraserhead. But for those who like their concepts challenged once in a while, this film will probably be one to watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to be forgotten easily. Love it or hate it, Eraserhead will stay with you for a very long time.
In a post-apocalyptic society, Henry Spencer (John Nance) works in a factory and has a girlfriend, Mary (Charlotte Stewart). When she gets pregnant, she moves to his apartment and delivers a mutant baby, who cries all the time. She can not bear the screams of the child, living Henry, who is on vacation, taking care of the newborn child and driving him insane."Eraserhead" gives the unique uncomfortable sensation of watching a harrowing nightmare. The bizarre characters, a trademark of David Lynch, together with an unbearable sound of machines working in a nasty environment of destruction give an amazing view of a possible pessimist future of mankind. The original cinematographic language of David Lynch in his first movie gives a magnificent sample of the future work of this great director, one of the best and more creative in the contemporary cinema industry. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available
I've watched Eraserhead countless times. In theaters. Off of the infamous Japanese-subtitled VCR copy. Off of the recent Lynch re-release. From around the late 70s onward. Yes, that long.I have friends who won't let me recommend movies to them any more.Anyway, the capsule summary, "Can't be summarized," is pretty close.First, it is not a movie. It is not a film.It is a piece of art.All of the comments I read that attempt to describe it as a movie fail for precisely that reason. If you read the ones that can handle it, they handle it as an art review.So don't even think of it as a movie. Don't recommend it as a movie. It doesn't work.I'll also admit that I sat in a haze for decades, absorbed in the imagery. In awe of the impressions. And finally, an image crystallized, an image of what this was a portrait of. (And, of course, I expect this image may change with repeated viewings...) And as I watch it, with this in mind, a continuity appears.We are living in hell, we just don't realize it.
This is why I am doing this whole thing. To watch a film like this. I have only seen three other Lynch films in their entirety (I'm still having trouble watching all of Inland Empire). I have no idea if people on this board like this film, but I do know that many here like Lynch and his unusual style. Saying unusual is an understatement too.The sound design in this film is phenomenal, if not bizarre and is the film's key ingredient. If this sound design did not work then I do not think the film would have such a cult following. Everything is heightened to an extreme and surreal beyond what one can imagine. Thew squeaking of the puppies, the disturbance of the radiator, so on and so on.If I were to actually try and figure out what the film was about, my head would explode ala Scanners. I get some themes and meanings, but was lost in the so called narrative, if you can call it that. Lynch has always been one for the abnormal things and this is no different. I can say that this is one of his weirder ones and that is saying a lot.The dream sequence ties into the title and seem to have nothing to do with the film, upon first look that is. Eraserhead is definitely a 'watch more then once' experience. You can debate with everyone about what the film was trying to say or what the hell is was even about, but no one can be certain. I don't even think Lynch knows.Now whenever you watch a film that is experimental, you try to find some value and meaning within it. You want it to be more than just another weird film for the sake of being weird. Lynch has been accused of this many times, but I think he is better than that. His films do have substance, you can tell in how he tells the story and how things seem to re-appear. Unlike other films where they pop up and are never seen again. Even though there are numerous scenes that just simply don't make sense to me, like when the daughter is sitting on the couch and doing something weird, then the mother brushes her hair. Even worse is when the chicken starts bleeding and the mother reacts to it in a bizarre manner.This is my least favourite of Lynch's films, for the simple fact that I never was interested in what little story there was. It didn't seem to go anywhere and for me to be invested in a film it has to be telling a story, one that I can understand, comprehend, or at the very least, try to look more into. Eraserhead did none of this for me. After watching it, I do not really care to watch it again to find any hidden meanings or to try and understand whatever it is that I missed from the first viewing. I can go on in life saying that Eraserhead did nothing for me and of course be hated for it, but whatever.But never say never right? Who knows, maybe one day down the road I'll get a chance to watch this so called 'masterpiece' again, and think it's brilliant. Until then, I'll say not.
Let's say it right here and now: David Lynch is a genius.  I don't care if you love him or hate him, you can't take away that simple fact. "Eraserhead" is his masterpiece -- the most original and personal film ever created by any film maker.  It's as far from the forgettable fluff of mainstream Hollywood as you can get, and as weird as it is, it strikes a chord deep in the human psyche. I don't think anyone could experience this film without being deeply moved. This beautiful, industrial nightmare comes as close to depicting a fever dream as any film ever could, or ever will! David Lynch pulled out all the stops to make "Eraserhead" as perfect as any film can be, and it shows. It is a great work of art in its own right. The characters and setting are unforgettable, and are as strange as they are familiar.  The story is slow-moving, but steadily builds with the fury of a small hurricane. The film walks a tightrope somewhere between the reality of the world we know, and "someplace else."  Where that is, only David Lynch knows for sure.  Lynch is a fine example of a film maker who isn't afraid to take huge risks. That's how masterpieces are made.  "Eraserhead" is the proof.
I like to think I have an open mind and look at movies or art objectively, which is why I gave Eraserhead a fair go. And I'm happy with horror or any movie going back to the silent era. I have a complete open mind.Unfortunately I did not enjoy Eraserhead at all and I was happy when it was over. Why so critical of one of David Lynch's acclaimed early work you may rightly ask? Well nothing really happens in it. For most part of the film centres in one room and on two things: the main protagonist and a very unusual looking baby. There is little dialogue, no plot or story or character development. My imagination was put into overdrive working out the scenes, any metaphors, whether the story took place in the past, future, some parallel universe or the warped mind of the protagonist of the film. Not a lot is given away. Eraserhead is abstract art in black & white. This may have worked in 1977 but now it feels very dated, not the least bit frightening, way too long and I am afraid boring.
Of a very divisive director, along with Mulholland Drive Eraserhead is one of his most polarising films, with people finding it wonderfully surreal, funny and unsettling and others will find it for their tastes confusing, too out there and weird. On first viewing the latter was the case with me(after being so amazed by the accessible emotional power that The Elephant Man and The Straight Story gave) but after further viewings(Lynch is one of those directors where each of his films should be seen more than once) now it's the former. While Eraserhead is not quite among Lynch's best films(Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story) it is still a very good, even great debut from him, albeit with some parts that are a bit too draggy and drawn out. Eraserhead looks splendid, it's beautifully shot and coupled with the film-noir-ish lighting it's a highly atmospheric-looking film. It's not a Lynch film without surreal imagery and Eraserhead is filled with that and in a way that even early in his career is very distinctive of Lynch. The score has an eerie tension and used in an understated way, not one of the best film scores out there but it suits the film well. The dialogue is spare, only about 21 minutes worth and while not exceptional it is a long way from poor, though maybe Eraserhead may have fared even better without it(big emphasis on maybe). Lynch's direction is for a debut very accomplished if not at his best, his direction in the likes of Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive was pretty much masterly. The story is distinctively surreal and oddball but also very expertly unnerving, Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man feel more accessible but Eraserhead is essentially a mood piece and works amazingly as one. The theme of a man fearing fatherhood will resonate with a lot of viewers too. The mutant baby is incredibly creepy but there is room for some funny moments in a very low-key way especially the dinner-table scene. The acting is great, especially from lead actor Jack Nance, what was most effective about his acting was how personal it felt, in fact the whole film felt very personal. Overall, will divide viewers, it did bewilder me at first, Eraserhead proves to be a very, very good debut as well as a very, very good film where no matter how you feel about the film you cannot deny that a lot of effort had been put into making it. 9/10 Bethany Cox
Horror movies have become pretty formulaic these days. They consist of either zombies, a masked killer, or a spooky entity terrorising a family. Even the better ones that subverted those sub-genres were still instantly recognisable as what they were and any that were hailed as 'original' were most likely remakes from Japanese films. However, back before CGI blood had become the norm and a group of five American teens could go on a road trip to the middle of nowhere without being picked off by pitchfork-wielding locals, came David Lynch's horror masterpiece, 'Eraserhead.' I guess it could be described as a bit of a 'passion project' as it took him years to make, due to him filming it while he studied/worked other jobs and generally did his best to get this movie financed. Now, you can probably tell that I'm a fan, however I will admit that no matter how much it appeals to me, it's definitely not for everyone. You could almost call it an 'art film' as it's filmed entirely in black and white and has little to no dialogue. The story – or at least what we can tell is a story – centres around a young, downtrodden man called Henry (played by long term friend and actor of David Lynch, Jack Nance) as he shuffles back and forth to and from his job to his flat in what looks like some sort of post apocalyptic industrial landscape. It's a bleak and meaningless existence for a man in a bleak and meaningless environment. I think the black and white adds to the overall mood of the tale. Whatever is really happening in Henry's world, he is merely a small cog in a much larger machine. However, just because his life is bleak doesn't seem to make it dull. He does seem to have a girlfriend. I use the word 'seem' as their relationship is never made truly clear. And, upon meeting her parents for the first time, discovers that there's a baby at the hospital and he's going to have to help look after it.Now, this may not sound like the most sinister and horrific story ever told. However, I may have slightly overlooked some of the other things that occur. For example the 'mini chickens' Henry eats at his potential inlaws' house appears to be alive. The baby is a deformed freakish-looking thing that may or may not even be human. It whines continuously and there's a lady living in his radiator with bizarre cheeks who crushes slithering worm-like creatures underfoot. Yes, it's weird. But then this comes from the mind of David Lynch – the man who eventually went on to give us Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Mullholland Drive and almost every other twisted, surreal modern nightmare ever put down on film.Now, as I say, it's not for everyone. It's hardly a 'date movie' and most people will probably be either bored or confused (or both). It's very slow. It doesn't make as much sense as most films with their classic Hollywood narratives and overall many will find it just too damn weird to be watchable. However, if you're in the mood for something a little different (and when I say 'different' I mean horrifically different!) then 'Eraserhead' is certainly a film that has to be watched to be experienced. Whether you end up loving it or hating it, it will definitely stick in your mind for many years to come.
When I first saw this film I thought all it was trying to do was create an uncomfortable atmosphere, but after a friend explained the imagery, David Lynch's genius became clear to me. These are the most important symbols. The worms represent sin. The baby represents the result of a sin. The radiator represents suicide. The girl behind the radiator represents death (she crushes the worms/sins) A thinking man's horror flick!
'Eraserhead', David Lynch's feature length debut, is the directors purest movie. A disturbing slice of surreal black comedy that is one of the most uncompromising movies ever made, and still one of the strangest. It's very much a love it or hate it kind of picture, and even viewers who enjoy many of Lynch's subsequent movies may find it difficult viewing. I'm not sure whether "like" is the best word to describe how I feel about it, but I admire it, and watch it every couple of years, and every time I watch it I am still astonished by it. Jack Nance stars as Henry, an average Joe living in a decidedly non-average world! Lynch used Nance in most of his movies after this, but for many he will always be remembered for 'Eraserhead', just like Jeffrey Combs will forever be associated with 'Re-Animator' and Bruce Campbell with 'The Evil Dead'. The plot of the film in many ways is very simple (Henry's girlfriend Mary gets pregnant, and the couple marry), but it gives absolutely NO indication of what a bizarre experience this movie is going to be! Anyone who has never seen it will be in for a shock, even if they are familiar with Lynch's other movies. Lynch's most recent picture, the grossly overrated 'Mulholland Dr.', had many people bending over backwards to "explain" and "solve" it as if it were a puzzle or game. 'Eraserhead' shows how futile it is to do that with Lynch's work. He is essentially an American surrealistic who delights in presenting weird and unexplained images to the viewer. 'Eraserhead' is full of them, but unlike 'Mulholland Dr.' (in my opinion), there is some kind of internal dreamlike logic, which while it may not "make sense" feels right. I would say the same thing about 'Lost Highway', his unfairly maligned movie, which to me ranks with 'Blue Velvet' as his most satisfying work to date. 'Mulholland Dr.' ultimately felt like a con job on the audience, 'Eraserhead' doesn't. That still doesn't mean it's easy to digest. It isn't. But it seems pure and real and doesn't appear to be playing cynical games with the viewer. 'Eraserhead', whether you truly enjoy it or not, is an important movie and is highly recommended to every movie fan. You may not want to watch it twice, but you really should see it at least once! There's nothing quite like it...
David Lynch's Eraserhead makes Being John Malkovich, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Lost Highway (another Lynch flick) combined look like they are chicken feed. And years later, having immersed myself in all of Lynch's work (minus Twin Peaks), going through numerous other "cult" and nightmarish films, and even recognizing the slower bits in the film, it still holds up for me as one of the filmmaker's masterpieces. Believe me, you will rarely see a stranger and more terrifying film in your lifetime until you see this. The plot (which if you can find you win a prize in your mind I think) has a weird zombie-like man (with a Al Sharpton like hair-do) who accidentally gets his spastic girlfriend pregnant and what comes out is a creature that is probably the unwanted child of an alien and a gasoline can. For most of the film though are images and scenes of macabre and fright that are authentic in their own way; abstractions that sometimes are humorous (the best being the highly uncomfortable and classic scene at dinner with the chickens) and sometimes purely out-of-this world. Lynch, while artistically might be by this work as mentally balanced as The Monster in Frankenstein, can make a film so weird, evil-feeling, yet compelling as all hell, that it boggles the mind. Very low budget, this is definitely one of the top 10 best debut films ever.
Eraserhead is easily the strangest cinematic work I have ever seen and that's coming from someone who is always made fun of for his love of "strange movies". Comparable art-house films such as Dr, Strangelove or Pi were easier to dissect and follow. This film is incredible in its imagery and its meaning attaches to reality below the basement floor of the subconscious. I would need to watch it several more times to try & unpack the symbolism to its full extent, but if I'm following Lynch I think its a visualization of a nightmare, or his deep impressions of what oppresses him in life. The movie is commendable for its originality, its creepy atmospheric soundtrack, its imagery & its ability to capture that same inescapable "doomy" feeling you have in a nightmare. The reason this won't won't go on my favorites list is because the lingering impression I have makes me feel yucky inside. My favorite artsy movies are ones that leave me feeling inspired & hopeful, not like Eraserhead which makes wake up out of this nightmare.
It puzzles me that anyone would rely on the term "surrealism." I suppose that one could say that everything that is not "real" is surreal, but what is the value in this? Annoyingly, newspaper critics toss the Quay Brothers, Bunuel, Jodorowsky, even early Cronenberg in the same bucket as Lynch and call that that.All art is surreal. If an artist is worth your investment, it is because she has something unique to offer. I'm not all that crazy about Bunuel, but his gift was how he could seamlessly merge the sense of things we know with those we lose control over. The Quays astound me with worlds invested in object views. Jodorowsky's stitching into the familiar is via worthy comment on theatrical tropes.Lynch is different, wholly different. A whole different experience.There are a number of ways to get from the world each viewer believes is real to the world of the film. That world by itself is less valuable than the connections that are maintained between the two worlds by the process of pulling them apart. These are what the artist can pull in changing your soul.Cronenberg for example does this by adding to certain elements of the ordinary and blowing them into crystalline forces. Many artists do this in a general sense. Cronenberg selects the most uncomfortable obsessive seeds to grow from. Madden from worried elements of memory.Why Lynch is so vitally important to your viewing journey is that he abstracts into his worlds by taking away rather than adding or expanding. I imagine his legendary bible verse, the one he says that "explains" this is a verse in the New Testament clearly not there and taken away, erased. Though Lynch is hardly a good authority on himself, this matters.This whole thing's value — and his much more mature "Inland Empire" — is about what he takes away. Lynch did not start as a filmmaker. Like Greenaway, he started as a painter. Painters understand this notion of showing by removing. He made extended studies of dessication with animal remains for years before entering the AFI program. One of them is here, the decayed hollow of some pet animal that Henry plays with via an attached wire and his shoe. Memories are made of what is omitted. The gift of birth is as much about the unmakings and undone as anything.Some of what Lynch does here fails I think because in spite of it all he could not escape some desire for overt obviousnessess. The business about the sperm- embryo- brainstem props is simply juvenile and gives stoners something to chortle about. He abandoned that stuff later. Really, "Empire" is where you need to be, with its erasures structured according to a polish tradition — which just happens to coincide with that missing bible passage.Lynch's God here should be taught in school, next to Joseph Smith's gently healthy patriarch.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.
I had always heard about this movie...about how it was very strange and it is hard to figure out what exactly is going on. By golly, it is very strange and hard to figure out. I watched this film and when it ended I was pretty much like, "What did I just watch?" A surreal type film where it seems Lynch is taking us to a world that is similar to ours in many ways, but vastly different than ours in very disturbing ways. A place where life is just as normal and dull as a day in our own lives, but at times is an utter nightmare so horrid that those who live within it just wish for death to escape it. Still, one wonders what it all means as this film kept becoming more and more bizarre as it progressed. A very disturbing film that had odd bits of humor here and there and periods where one felt uncomfortable to watch.The story has a man named Henry. He is apparently on vacation and his girlfriend apparently wants him over for dinner. He goes to this dinner only to learn that not only is Mary's family very strange, but also that Mary has had a child...or perhaps something else as Mary herself said that they were not even sure it was a baby. Well, Henry becomes a father unexpectedly and soon his girlfriend leaves him with said child. He becomes frustrated and wants the neighbor across the hall, but is also drawn to the mysterious girl within the radiator who sings of heaven.At times, I have no idea what is going on, but at other I feel almost as if I do. When Henry goes to meet his girlfriend's parents it almost seems to me that Henry suffers from social anxiety disorder. That everything is being blown out of proportion by his condition. Suffering from this condition when I come upon things I am not used to and being around people I am unfamiliar everything seems to go wrong in my mind and the most awkward situations keep popping up. Like how he gets roped into carving the chicken which promptly bleeds and the mother runs out of the room screaming and then the father tries to have a conversation with Henry who is very uncomfortable at the moment. Then other parts of the film are just so strange that I am unable to figure out what is going on except Henry is becoming increasingly unhappy and frustrated. However, he seems to find relief at the end as the last shot of him embracing the girl in the radiator shows him having an expression of pure relief.So, this film was well done and is something that is up for interpretation. I do not find it pretentious as I feel a more pretentious film shows imagery that tries to make it look like it is showing something really deep, but in reality means absolutely nothing. Here, I do get a sense that there is something behind what is being presented. Lynch did an excellent job of presenting this strange world and I would almost like to see more of it as it is such a strange and horrific place. Henry's story ended, but perhaps another viewpoint could have been done at one point of this nightmarish realm that so mirrors our world, but at the same time has deep cracks in it.
One of the better arguments I've heard against all David Lynch movies is that all the artsy fartsy explanations are empty because despite over intellectualizing the movie at their core really are plottless and that no one understands them because David Lynch is f**kin crazy! It can be then stated that if people watch something they don't understand and like it anyway then that can mean they can be watching any images on the screen and it wouldn't matter. It's like putting a baby in front of the TV, the baby isn't so intrested in what's actually on the screen as much as it's intrested in the fact that anything is on the screen at all. It's all just fodder for dumb monkeys with Nikes. This theory seems pretty airtight to me because admittedly I don't have any idea what's going on most of the time in David Lynch movies. This one I think I have a pretty good idea. I often hear the word nightmare mentioned along side Eraserhead. Most of the time the word as used as a generic term without much thought. But if you think about nighmares or dreams in general you might think of times where you've had dreams that you just don't understand because nothing makes sense in them. For instance you might have a dream that seems allmost perfectly rational, but always there will be one or two elements that don't quite fit in. Like you're having a dream where your having sex with your best friend's kid sister in her room, but then she asks you about your eye color and suddenly her room is your third grade class and your covered in ants. Doesn't make two bits of sense and is so non-linear that it's beyond comprehension. So instead of the term nightmarish being generically used, it actually is acurately applied. All that aside you can start think about this movie on drugs. Anyone who as ever done acid can claim two things. One, is that under the world of drugs nothing makes two much sense in the immediate sense, only the overall reality is understood, if at all. Two, we've all heard the stories of somebody's bad trip. Usually something along the lines of, he thought the couch was trying to eat him so he attacked it with my uncle's set of ginsu's. Well put these two idea's together and a thought forms. How little sense does the world make to someone on a bad trip of acid, let alone the WORST TRIP EVER!!!!!!?  I think you hear me knocking. This movie began production around 1972, right around the end Woodstock generation and the heyday of LSD consumption. It's not all that unlikely that this is either Lynch recounting his own acid trip which would explain his subsequeent insanity, or a tale Lynch might have heard from a friend of a friend.
PS Show this movie to your twelve year old child after having explained how great the wonders of hallucinogens are, and that they're all like this. Chances are you kid will never touch the stuff.
The first time I saw "Eraserhead" was in the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton. My friend Gerry had already seen it in San Francisco and was still in paroxysms of praise for the picture so I went in with high expectations; even so, I still wasn't prepared for what I saw that night. I was meeting Gerry in the bar next door afterwards but when I left the cinema I was still in something of a daze, or perhaps a trance, and started walking in the wrong direction. I knew I had seen some kind of masterpiece but I also knew here was a film I wouldn't want to sit through again, at least not for a very long time. Well, here we are 40 years later and I've just seen "Eraserhead" again. For anyone still ignorant of the fact, "Eraserhead" was the film that introduced David Lynch to the world and a few minutes into the film was enough to tell us that here was a singular new talent worthy to sit on a pedestal next to the young Welles, not that Welles would ever make a film like "Eraserhead"; indeed who, other than Lynch, would. There is a plot of sorts but essentially Lynch's film, luminously shot in black and white by Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, unfolds like a living nightmare, but whose? Lynch's? Henry's, (the central character that established Jack Nance as a cult actor for a new generation), or our own? Certainly there are images here enough to give the strongest of us nightmares, images and sounds, (this film has some of the finest sound designs ever recorded). It has been described as experimental, as avant-garde and by some just as a plain old horror film. You could say it's also a kind of love story, though a very warped and forbidding one. Lynch, of course, would go on to the likes of "Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks" and would never fully abandon the sensibilities first seen in this extraordinary film. I was more prepared for it this time but it still blew me away.
After hearing how wonderful this movie was from multiple friends, I gave in and rented it one evening. It was an evening that I wish I could have back. Very rarely do I stop watching a movie before it is done, but that's exactly what I did here. The thing was so ridiculous that I simply could not bear it. The film opens up with the main character of the movie, Henry. Henry is a very strange man, as he seems to walk around in a daze, and live in a very strange and rundown building. In fact, most of the people seem to be walking around in a daze. I guess that's what happens after nuclear disaster. which is what is supposed to have happened, according to a friend. After 30 minutes of film (or did it just seem like 30 minutes), Henry has done nothing nothing whatsoever except walk around in a daze and mutter to himself, all very strangely; finally going over to his girlfriend's house for dinner. His girlfriend and her family are all blank stares and three-word phrases as Henry is. When the dinner is served, the main course, which appears to be some kind of game hen or pheasant, starts moving around on the plate, making little noises and oozing a black fluid. Henry and crew give their game hens blank stares and seem vaguely sad. It was at this point that I shut the tape off. I contemplated opening my second story window and casting it out, saving my town from the stupidity that is that film, but thought better and returned it instead. I have never liked anything else David Lynch has directed. Most people are convinced that he is a genius, so perhaps I'm just not clever enough to "get it", but I don't think so. I had the same kind of reaction when Twin Peaks was on television. I watched one episode because everyone said it was "genius", but it did nothing but irritate me throughout, and surprise me that people could be such horrible actors. If you are bound and determined to rent Eraserhead, then please find a discount rental store, or use a free rental coupon or something. Perhaps you will see in it something that I did not, this "genius" that everyone else seems to see, but if you are like me, then it will be all you can do to restrain yourself from taking your VCR, Eraserhead and all, burying it in your backyard, and going off to live with the Amish.
Is Eraserhead weird? Yes, it is. Is Eraserhead "out there"? Most Definitely. Does Eraserhead's story even come close to promoting sharp thinking or inspiring bright ideas? Nope, it does not. It numbs and paralyzes any clear, lucid thought like the dull thud of a sledgehammer-blow applied directly to the skull. If you're seriously looking for a movie that actually induces brain-freeze (without the aid of drugs), then look no further than Eraserhead. Here's a movie that probably contains more "WTF?" moments than any other mainstream film in existence. But, of course, when it comes to these particular moments, the major problem here is that they just stack up way too high, leaving the viewer quite frustrated, annoyed and often gasping for a breath of honest-to-goodness fresh air after being suffocated (literally) by a non-stop barrage of irritating and nonsensical situations. The way I look at it, if it's considered hip and cool to be one of the chosen elite who love to gush and heap praise upon Eraserhead, then I can't begin to tell you how much it pleases me to know that I am looked upon as being an outcast and certified square. Due to a truly terrible sense of storytelling (which starts from out of nowhere and ends in the very same spot), I view Eraserhead as being something of an idiot's jigsaw puzzle where none of the ill-fitting pieces were ever intended to fit together into a coherent and satisfyingly entertaining whole, at all. I personally place full blame for Eraserhead's countless flaws and irksome short-comings directly on the shoulders of writer/director David Lynch. On top of being a total wiener-head, I think that Lynch is a frickin' pseudo-intellectual snob of the highest order. To me, Eraserhead was a film that wasn't made by someone who wanted to share any special or meaningful insights with his audience, at all. No. This was a film made by someone who was clearly looking down his long nose at his audience and saying, loud & clear - "Ponder this, you stupid, low-life peasants!" As far as I'm concerned, the only appealing and noteworthy aspect about Eraserhead was its (sometimes) startling b&w camera-work. But, since this film's story (more often than not) nearly put me off to sleep, it only earns for itself a 3-star rating.
i sometimes wonder if people like lynch make movies with complete random crap in them just to see how many people they can convince that its art, or a masterpiece. i can imagine lynch sitting in a room reading all the praise for eraserhead and laughing at how many pretentious people buy it as a serious piece of film-making. that aside, before a hundred more 'open minded' sorts bash me for missing the point, i'd like to think i understand why other people like it. I hate this movie. I'm surprised i lasted the full running time. i don't think there's a film out there that i've seen, that has made me want to pierce my eyes and ears more than when i watched eraserhead (ok, 'love, actually'). And maybe its designed to make you feel uncomfortable, maybe that's part of its 'power', but to me that doesn't make it a good film. as far as i know, there are very few people who would actually take pleasure in wanting to stab themselves in the eye. To its credit, its a film open to interpretation, but all the people i know who enjoyed it are annoying film students who like to over analyse movies (but if he puts his hand there, what does that mean???... er nothing) and look as if their cultured and have a grasp of film language. Watch it if you like, you may take something away from it that i missed or ignored, but don't say i didn't warn you if you find your eye on the end of a fork.
"Eraserhead" (1077 release; 89 min.) brings the story of Henry Spencer. As the movie opens, Herny leads a bleak existence in an industrial wasteland. Henry is invited over for dinner by Mary, his girlfriend. Her parents are there to.. Mary's mother corners Henry, asking why he is having sexual relations with Mary, and that they now must marry and carry for the premature baby Mary bore. We shift to later, as Mary now lives with Henry, and they care for the premature baby... At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this is the debut feature length film of writer-producer-director David Lynch. It's obviously a labor of love, albeit a complicated one. Production took a good 5 years as financing was very difficult (basically the early 70s version of GoFundMe or Kickstarter). As to the film itself, it is so wild and off center, there are basically no words for it. It is an industrial sci-fi film? horror film? both? more? Frankly all of the above. Please pay close attention to the sound collage, carefully drafted by Lynch and others, and present in virtually every second of the movie. It's probably what inspired Trent Resnor and Atticus Ross to do what they do nowadays. I had seen this movie back in the day (late 70s), possibly even more than once. But I hadn't seen this in forever, literally decades. I had lost all recollection of what the story was about, the only thin I remembered what the view of Henry as it appears in the movie poster. I was floored when seeing this again recently how well this movie has aged. Basically it's a timeless movie that could've been made today but instead was made 45 years ago. It blows the mind. This of course launched David Lunch's brilliant movie-making career. What a debut film! "Eraserhead" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The theater adheres strictly to all COVID-19 requirements, including social distancing, mask wearing and taking one's temperature before entering the theater. Not that it mattered, as the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening: I literally was the only person in the theater. Meanwhile, if you are into David Lynch and by chance have never seen it (or it's been a long time), I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.
Simply put, this horror/science fiction filmed in black and white could be used to drive a potential mad men right over the edge. I enjoy black and white comedy films such as 1974's Young Frankenstein, and/or the 2011 The Artist. As for this so-called critically acclaimed now available as part of the Criterion Collection film collection I have to ask. Why? Is this film different from everything else? Yes Is the coiffe hairdo on lead actor Jack Nance weird enough? Yes (But so is lead singer's Mick Hucknall hairdo of Simply Red fame but I don't want to see him starring in a horror film) The sound effects are not haunting, but they are very irritating. I found no redeeming features in director David Lynch's first ever major film and I wonder how he got a second chance after releasing this film? Oh! I think I can figure out by the financial numbers attached to this piece of crap. Budget $20K Gross $7M There is a huge market for the artsy fartsies of the world. There is a famous quotation by American circus showman P.T. Barnum in which he says "There is a sucker born every minute." If you watch Eraserhead...welcome to the club! I give it a 3 out of 10 rating
I have watched this movie well over 20 times in the past 20 years and grabbed the David Lynch DVD of the film as soon as it came out. This is indeed one of the icons of cult movie making and one of my top 10. The problem is that, it is almost unwatchable on first viewing. It took me three or four tries to get through the entire movie back in the early 80s. Also, I would not recommend anything except an excellent reproduction such as the Lynch DVD in order to make out all the details in the sometimes grainy B&W. Thus rentals don't work out here. If you are a committed fan of unusual films, give it a try. What is the allure of this film? First, it's dreamlike quality. Second, Jack Nance's performance as the main character Henry. Third, Henry's interaction with the "baby", which moves from puzzlement to annoyance, then fear and finally extreme hatred. Upon multiple viewings, it does start to exhibit its own logic, but insisting on this is like saying that a dream is only interesting if it makes sense. Is it entertaining? Yes, I reached that point somewhere around the 10th to 15th viewing. This is a bit of a commitment. Try watching Elias Merhige's Begotten first and Eraserhead won't seem nearly as strange.
This legendary film by David Lynch is definitely one of the most disturbing and scary films of all time. It is amazing how David is able to make ordinary things and items from every day life look so scary and menacing. It is impossible to say there is just one way to see this film or other films by Lynch so what I'm going to write is just my opinion and interpretation. It would be more than interesting to discuss these things with the director himself.. Eraserhead works for me mostly on the level of its imagery and effects to create such a nightmare as it is. The film is pure nightmare from which you can awake only to even more frightening "real world" whatever it in Lynch's world is! I would see Eraserhead as a paranoid study of something taken over humans and controlling them. The menace may be for example the development of technology, which has become the enemy for its creators. Humans can't control their creations anymore, because they are being used (the "eraser" scene at the factory) by their own work. Also, there is a theme of humanity being totally lost and people being destroyed as there are many "mutants" and abnormal characters as the baby itself and the attractive singer in the radiator. The sound effects, imagery, little details (which are dozens again) and totally irrational storytelling have created one of the most impressive cinematic nightmares (not dreams, nightmares!) I've ever witnessed and so this can be described as horror experience, even though this is not just a horror film. Eraserhead is very difficult film and will never unfold to mainstream audience, because the film is too much for even some film buffs who can't understand and appreciate it at all. David Lynch is one of the most important artist in this field, and his surreal and unique work must be experienced many times and every time they will unfold more and you'll understand new aspects in them. These films should definitely be seen in movie theater, but unfortunately it is not always possible, so the home viewing experience should be made as intense and peaceful as possible. Unmatchable cinema, 10 full stars for the great film maker's early achievement.
Without a shadow of a doubt, this is 100% the WEIRDEST, most SURREAL film I have EVER seen. Iwould say this is just as good as Mulholland Drive, even thought I find that film kind of overrated. My second David Lynch film, and its even stranger than the first. First of all I wanna say that this movie was boring and one of the single most twsited hard-to-understand films I've ever come across. BUT... this is not a bad thing. If someone were to ask me "what is a movie that would genuinely SCARE me? I'm tired of all these mainstream horror movies not scaring me." One of like 5 recommendations would be Eraserhead. This psychologically destroyed my brain. Crazy how a $10k black and white movie that nobody understands from 1977 can be scarier than a multi-million dollar mainstream "horror" movie. So from what I understand this film is trying to explore the horrors of becoming a new parent. These horrors are truly things that every man and woman experience (if they are about to have a kid that is) in their lifetime. Their worries are off the charts and it can cause constant stress. I believe that may be what happened to our main character here. Honestly though, I could have that completely wrong, but who cares. Everything that happened in this film may be an interpretation of what is happening inside Henry's head, all caused by the stress of having a new child. There are still many moments and things I don't understand about this film, so I'll have to watch a few videos on it to grasp it better. If you really want to be scared/psychologically screwed, watch this movie.
Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is a quiet factory worker living in an industrial landscape. He and his girlfriend Mary X has a child but it is a malformed inhuman baby. Mary can't take the crying and walks out. I am very reluctant to put down any more plot details because I'm not sure about a lot of what I saw. There are some crazy surreal stuff here. It's part Kafka. The baby is like some weird Cronenberg creature. Nance is doing most of his acting thru his hair. This is a lot of weird ideas from the mind of David Lynch. It kind of overwhelms any story in the end. It reminds me of the second season of 'Twin Peaks' where his craziness becomes greater than any traditional story or even the characters.
This film is the kind of self-indulgent trash which gives independent movie-making such a bad name. Truly a film which provides more nightmarish visions of filming technique than nightmarish visions. The actors can't act, they can't react, they look awful, and consequently none were ever heard of again. The positive aspect of this film is David Lynch's example that no matter how big a screw-up you make you can still achieve success!The worst film I have seen (out of around 1,500 films).
Perhaps the most morbid, darkest movie ever made. Totally abstract; to discuss the "plot" here would be to miss the point. Did I say "point"? I'm not sure there is a point. But there doesn't have to be one. Eraserbrain is almost totally free for interpretation. Part horror, part futuristic drama, part mystery. It defies definition. Some scenes are downright chilling, some are absolutely gross, and in-between there is plenty of eerie, dark, confusing, abstract melodrama. The few dialogues that take place - even though mostly weird - give a little bit of a breather. Hard to watch, especially repeatedly, this is definitely not entertainment in the classic sense. Nevertheless, it is utterly fascinating. Hard to believe that it was directed by the same David Lynch who gave us such beautiful-people yuppie-mystery crap like "Twin Peaks", and who started casting Laura Dern in his films, probably because he saw "talent" in her. Or maybe because he is fascinated by freaks? There is a very nice song(!) here, sung by the "radiator lady", somewhere in the second half. In hindsight, decades after the fact, it is almost funny that Eraserbrain has no proper story (or at least no proper story development), considering that Lynch became later notorious for setting up complex mysteries - but then completely unable to untangle/resolve them in any logical, meaningful way. Of course, Lynch's rabid fan army would vehemently deny that; they all used generous helpings of glue to help them "explain" all these quasi-profound "arty" films. Whoever claims that "this is the movie that got me interested in cinema" is a lying attention-seeking insecure hipster. "Star Wars" or "Dumbo" were what got you into cinema, you pompous clods! Stop pretending you enjoyed this when you were 11.
So, I was in college at the time, see, and a few of my rather mix and match friends were sitting around my dorm room and for the lack of anything better to do, we decided to catch one of the movies playing on campus. The movie we chose to see was Eraserhead. We made it through the movie all right, but as we left one friend exclaimed, "That was the worst movie I have ever seen!" "Me too!" said a second, and one by one, we all jumped in with the same verdict: Eraserhead was the worst, vilest, boringest piece of crap any of us had ever seen. But the story does not end there. Some weeks later, one of that set of friends noted, "Hey, remember that Eraserhead movie? That scene with the girl in the radiator? Well maybe..." and off she went on an interpretive spree. And later, another friend found himself recalling the film, and a scene, and what he felt it might of meant, and another and another... Until we finally realized that the movie was not bad; we were a bad audience. We had not captured and seen the quality of the movie, the ideas being expressed, the depth of the allegory, and stuff. The next year, the movie came around on campus again. The same group, minus one who had graduated, armed with our prior viewing experience, ready to meet the director on his own terms, marched to the on campus theater to see it again. The result? Eraserhead was the worst, vilest, boringest piece of crap any of us had ever seen. There's a lesson in there.To review David Lynch's "Eraserhead" is to review the man himself, which is nearly impossible since he's as enigmatic as what he puts on screen (images oozing out gracefully, sometimes grotesquely). It isn't any wonder why Lynch's output has made him a cult figure and hero: he simply doesn't pander to any known movie regulations (he's his best audience), and his very dry humor reaches us cautiously, creeping up like fingers from beyond the grave. Lynch directs nightmares, but not just anybody's nightmares. His horrific hallucinations seem to stem from childhood--a lone boy's mounting terror at being sucked down into the unknown--and yet he revels in the experience. He's a consummate filmmaker, and often a quiet masochist, but if a viewer isn't attuned to Lynch's rhythms--or his fascination with the perverse--the twisted imagery just starts to look silly and self-indulgent. "Eraserhead" concerns two unwed freaks and their mutant offspring, and it is filmed in startling black-and-white utilizing a fine central actor (John "Jack" Nance, whose perplexity and child-like confusion is the most sympathetic part of the picture). David Lynch is green here, and probably unconcerned with audience reaction, but his style (a series of sickly scenes of human deterioration) is certainly gripping. The film is really not much more than a project, a talented student showing off, and it isn't absorbing as a whole. But in vignette form, and surely in retrospect, "Eraserhead" holds a peculiar power unmatched by any picture from a major Hollywood studio. Its eerie ambiance isn't accidental--Lynch is quite calculating as a scenarist and as a director--although the end results could be less personal than anyone realizes. It could be the ultimate in-joke on celluloid.
I legitimately don't know how anyone could sit through this and say "yeah, that was amazing". Like are you serious? This was pretentious, forced, boring, and repetitive. Dialogue sucks, camera work sucks, the forced "making you think deeply" agenda doesn't work because there is no story. Complete and utter bore, anyone who says they understood or liked this movie is lying. I wish I could give it negative 50 0's. Do not waste your time on this trash.
David Lynch's first movie. Surreal, pretentious, meaningless nonsense. Was interesting for a while, but then just degenerated into nonsensical, random imagery. Only thing I learned from this is that David Lynch didn't start making pretentious crap with Lost Highway - it started with his first movie.
Eraserhead (1977) is a cult classic horror movie from David Lynch. I recently watched this movie two times. The first time I saw this movie was in my film class. I had no idea what to think of it. This is because the movie simply blew my mind. A friend and I had a discussion after watching the film. I said I had no idea how to interpret it. He said that this was his second time watching it. He said that I would like the movie a lot more if I watched it again. After watching this movie for the second time, I have learned to appreciate and love this film. It is pure surrealist art on film. It never explains itself because it doesn't need to. My favorite part of the movie was undeniably the visuals. Absolutely gorgeous. They blew me away. The movie definitely warrants multiple viewings. The ending scene honestly scared the hell out of me. This movie is definitely over the top, which is one of my only problems with it. The whole movie scares and engrosses you at the same time. This has become one of my favorite horror movies of all time.
I'm all for surrealism, hidden messages, and hidden meanings in films but, when your film's ONLY meaning is the hidden meaning and viewing it any other way is just a jumble of nonsensical scenes with an incoherent narrative, I have a problem. Especially when you (or rather David Lynch) refuses to even remotely explain the movie. I guess that sense of mystery and interpretation may have some appeal to others but, to me, this is hands down the worst film I have ever seen. I don't mean I dislike it. I mean it is LITERALLY at the bottom of the list of movies I've seen. To elaborate a bit, I've looked up several interpretations of the film and not a single one of them made the movie any better for me.
As an admirer of David Lynch's work I think that Eraserhead is the most fitting introduction to this man's World as you are likely to get. It was on the strength of this film that Mel Brooks chose David to direct Elephant Man. Having said that can't you see the similarities in style and content? Saying Lynch is weird is like saying the Beatles wrote good pop music. Lynch's weirdness can effect one on a very profound, almost spiritual level, eg Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks. Eraserhead is a hard film to enjoy but it's well worth the effort, if only for Jack Nance's superb visual performance, and a deeper appreciation of Lynch's mis-en-scene.
You have to admire director David Lynch's creativity and for the focus he had in putting his vision on film. In 'Eraserhead', he creates a dehumanizing and nightmarish world, hyperbolically amplifying the awkwardness and isolation many feel in real life. He uses black and white film, light and shadow, long, drawn out takes, and ghoulish, haunting sounds in addition to 'creepy', outrageous moments to play this up. The result is absurdity along the lines of Franz Kafka's 'The Metamorphosis', and if you like Kafka or highly unconventional movies with a dark take on life, you'll probably love this one. For my taste, though, while it held my interest and I appreciated what Lynch was going for, it's just a little too dark.
Utterly pointless and nonsensical claptrap that not even Lynch would have known the meaning behind. All those 10/10 reviews by those that pretend to "get it" are hilarious. There is nothing to get or indeed any hidden messages, just meaningless garbage masquerading as being some form of art !
Left alone to care for his deformed baby, a depressed factory worker questions his sanity in this nightmarish debut feature from David Lynch. While not a film for all tastes, the movie works surprisingly well both literally and metaphorically. If taken literally, one might view the baby as an animalistic creature that his wife's parents have used to con him into marriage. On a metaphorical level, one wonders whether the baby really looks so alien-like or whether Jack Nance's protagonist simply perceives him like that. Nance provides a very human performance, full of sympathetic looks of despair, and the film could be seen as his reaction to finding out that he is a father and being unable fathom that a little bit of himself is in the baby. Then there's the fact that the baby would have to be several months premature to actually be he is, so the film could represent his uncertainty about whether he really is the father (maybe his girlfriend slept around) with good reason therefore as to why he does not recognise this little stranger in his house. Whatever the case, the film is a triumph of atmosphere with Lynch creating unease purely through accentuating everyday noises at key points. At times it feels like Lynch is just doing weird things for the sake of it here - but to no greater degree than in any of Lynch's other works. You have to know what you're in for with this film, but when watched in the right mood, it is a blast.
Unlike most directors, who want to eliminate background noise, David Lynch racks it up here to make it a key character. It's also the driving essence of the film - from the mechanical thrumm of the industry nearby, to the singing radiator and to the "baby" crying continuously. Against this aural assault, in the grimy black and white of Lynch's darkest psyche, lie layer upon layer of absurdities and creepy oddities. Setting the scene is the tiny, claustrophobic room that the weirdly- haircutted Henry Spence (Jack Nance) inhabits, along with all its creepy idiosyncrasies, like the radiator that sings to him. Henry's girlfriend, Mary X lives with him and Henry gives her a child. This "creature", partly the alien coming out of John Hurt's stomach in 'Alien' and half 'Little Otik', the tree-based part baby, part log from the Czech semi-animated film of the same name, could compete as the ugliest single thing you've ever seen. And win, no question. It demands constant attention but Mary X is too emotionally drained to look after it and so leaves Henry with the little, VERY ugly mite. Then it gets some sort of disease which made it look ten times uglier and horrific. From then on, it just seemed to get more and more weird, with more and more disturbing images. From about a third way in, I was questioning not just whether I actually wanted to watch this film now, but at all. From two thirds on, one atrocious bit turned into another and like having an injection at the dentist, all I could do was to just hang on until it stopped. I certainly don't consider myself a wuss, or a prude and can watch almost anything but this endurance test was just a bit too much. I give three stars as it certainly is ground-breaking, very different and daring. And for a debut piece that had huge problems getting funding ($20,000 for only a 20 page script - that actually grossed $7,000,000 - not a bad return!) it has to be admired. I then deleted it from my TV service provider's box that I had recorded it from The Horror channel - as I never want to see it ever again!
I was scanning through the other commentaries on this film and I noticed that most of them used either the word "genius" or the phrase "work of art" in reference to Mr. Lynch's work. If we define genius as an unusually powerful capacity for doing original, inventive work, then we must decide whether or not this film meets that criteria. It is unusual, there's no denying that. If by powerful you mean that it stirs the emotions, and we are discussing a piece of work in an art form and the measurement of whether or not something is a work of art is if it affects the emotions, then yes, it is powerful. Emotions can be affected in a positive or a negative manner by a work of art. The imagery in this film is dark and disturbing. It is an experimental film, which tends to make one think of it as original and inventive. It could easily be said that it is not, in that dark, spooky films about grotesques have been made almost from the beginning of movies. But just because a certain type of film has been made before doesn't detract from the quality of the film under discussion. The real issue here is whether or not Mr. Lynch's work can stand as an organic whole. This is where I think it begins to get into trouble. Mr. Lynch has filled the film with images that probably mean something to him. However he doesn't communicate that meaning to his audience except for an overall feeling of repugnance and dread. If we go back to the concept that a work of art's primary function is to communicate an emotion, that perhaps that is enough. However, a film, and this one is no exception, is a narrative. Narratives are supposed to communicate ideas. They tell stories. This film tells a story, but the characters are doing things, and events are happening that don't make any sense. Mr. Lynch probably knows what's going on but he doesn't share that knowledge with the audience. The film is filled with powerful images but they don't coalesce into a coherent story. There is no why and wherefore. I'm sure many people will say that a work of genius doesn't have to explain itself. It just is. That's a point of view, but most people require some sort of meaning in order to derive enjoyment from a film. Is mood enough of a meaning to make people want to sit through a movie?
Man, this is a powerful and great movie. We are all moved different degrees by different things, but to witness sincerely nice people being treated cruelly always bothers me big- time....so this film is tough to watch in spots. Some scenes are just painful and depressing to view. Whatever your sensitivity, the movie is very involving and hauntingly shown with eerie black-and-white photography. Eerie, and downright beautiful camera-work in here, so kudos to cinematographer Freddie Francis, one of the best in the business.A young Anthony Hopkins is very likable and John Hurt is, well, someone you won't soon forget as John Merrick, "The Elephant Man."This is an uplifting movie at times, too, not just a tear-jerker or horrific in showing man's cruelty to man. Be prepared for an emotional experience and an amazing story.
I first watched 'The Elephant Man' over twenty years ago, not long after it was released. It was the first David Lynch movie I ever saw, thought at the time I'd never even heard about 'Eraserhead' and knew nothing about the guy. I was incredibly impressed by the film, as I have been every time I watch it. Eventually I became a big Lynch fan, and could see the similarities between 'Eraserhead' and 'The Elephant Man', both visually and in their use of sound. Apart from that, they are very different movies. 'Eraserhead' still freaks most people out, but 'The Elephant Man' is arguably his most accessible film. It has heart and an emotional impact, something rare in Lynch's movies ('The Straight Story' is another exception). Anthony Hopkins is an actor I've frankly had it up to HERE with, especially after his increasingly hammy Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but boy, is he wonderful here! Probably his finest performance to date. Of course John Hurt is superb too, especially taking into consideration him having to work under pounds of make up. It's hard to fault anybody in the supporting cast, especially John Gielgud and Hannah Gordon, who plays Hopkins wife. Freddie Jones, who Lynch has worked with a few times since, is really evil as Bytes, and the late Michael Elphick ('The Element Of Crime', 'Withnail and I') plays another memorable baddie as the hospital's night porter. 'The Elephant Man' is a remarkable achievement. Lynch doesn't seem to have compromised his unique vision one bit and yet manages to make a genuinely moving drama about one of the screen's most unlikely heroes. I don't throw the term "masterpiece" around lightly but it's difficult not to use that word when describing this truly extraordinary film! Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen.
THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) **** John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, Wendy Hiller, Freddie Jones, John Gielgud.  David Lynch's masterpiece of the human spirit about the true-life account of John Merrick, a hideously deformed man in England's Victorian Age, who was taken in by a physician after a hellish stint in a freak show.  Hurt rises to the occasion and delivers a heart wrenching Oscar nominated performance emoting under tons of make-up to full effect.  Equally good is Hopkins in low-key form as the humanitarian doctor.  Beautiful black and white photography resonates the production; nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Lynch and Best Picture. Best scenes: Hurt's recital of the 23rd Psalm and his immortal line: "I am not an animal, I am a human being!"  Incredibly powerful ending perfectly accentuated by the classical "Adagio For Strings".  Dare not to be moved. One of the best.   Trivia note, look for little person Kenny Baker during the carnival sequences; he's the guy inside R2-D2 in `Star Wars' and the head bandit in `Time Bandits'.
There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outer appearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!
You have got to love the Elephant Man. There isn't one scene that doesn't move me. It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, "I am not an animal, I am a human being," I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1/10, what is wrong with you? This is an absolute masterpiece, without question! 10/10. Bethany Cox
Anthony Hopkins is so associated with Hannibal Lecter, that we almost forget that he did star in movies before that. "The Elephant Man", for example. It's sort of hard to determine whether the main character is disfigured John Merrick (John Hurt) or Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins). Either way, it's the movie's plot that's important. The plot of course shows how Merrick has been treated as a monster all his life and Treves tries to cure him. As for the possibility that the movie may have revered its subject too much...well, would you feel comfortable mocking him? A particularly interesting combo is the people behind the movie: director David Lynch and executive producer Mel Brooks (Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft appears as an actress). The former is synonymous with deliberately weird cinema, while the latter is synonymous with silliness. Both men show a different side here. All in all, this is definitely a movie that everyone should see.
If one was to turn on David Lynch's The Elephant Man midway through, without knowing what it was, one might be startled at the appearance of the main character. One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one's sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), 'The Elephant Man,' would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he's there. There he is. And it's no big deal. This is the beauty of Lynch's direction. We are led through our morbid curiosity at the same rate the characters in the film are. We develop alongside them. More specifically, we develop alongside Frederick Treeves, played with an astounding sublimity of emotion by Anthony Hopkins. Next to Treeves we pity Merrick, respect him, pity him again, and then ask ourselves with him, 'is he just a spectacle to me? Am I a bad person?'Lynch certainly doesn't let us bypass this question easily. Are we bad people for being intrigued or are we good people for pitying? Certainly there is a mix of intrigue and pity with every character who first meets John, and we are not excluded. However, as with almost every character who truly comes to know John and confer with him, we learn to respect him as a human being and not as a spectacle. Nonetheless, this issue never finds close in the film, nor do I feel it ever can be closed in actual life. Hopkin's Treeves is never fully sated in how he feels about this dilemma, and so, neither can we be.Technically, The Elephant Man is a beautifully shot film. In crisp black and white, the film recalls the cinematic technique of American cinema circa the 1930's. The scenes dissolve into one another; there is no brisk editing. The lighting is kept low-key during dark scenes, balanced during daytime scenes-this is standard film-making of the era. The one digression from this form are the distinctly Lynchian surrealities-pseudo-dream-sequences of commendably original imagery that break up the film and serve as distinct mood-setters for the audience. These are, for the most part, fairly intimidating sidenotes. We as an audience are caught off-guard because in these tangents we are not identifying with Treeves, we are put instead into Merrick's shoes. It is unsettling.But Lynch has never been a director to flinch at unsettling prospects. We must watch Merrick beaten, abused, harassed, humiliated, and tormented. We may feel a surge of happiness when he finally stands up for himself, but by that point we still have to cope with what we've already, what he's already, experienced. I suppose that is the greatest and most devastating aspect of the film-empathy. Every moment is heartbreaking. Yet no matter how hard it gets, and how much better it then turns, there is always the threat of another jab. And those jabs only get more and more painful.The Elephant Man is a perfect film. It is sorrowful but it apologizes not at all for it. It is a film about where our empathy stems from, a film that asks you to feel sorry but rebukes you for your blind pity. It asks you to respect Merrick, not cry for him. But you can't help crying. The Elephant Man is a film that treks you through despair and asks for your hope in the end. It asks you to hate humanity but to love the humane. It asks you to look at a man who appears sad and know that inside, he's okay.
There is no feeling, no virtue, no human baseness "The Elephant Man" doesn't scrutinize: hypocrisy, cruelty, mercy, sadism, love...). David Lynch reached the status of genius with his second movie, he created an instant classic for the history of cinema, a masterpiece. He probed his huge talent beyond the oniric or surrealistic fits of "Eraserhead" (and of most of his filmography). He probed he's capable of doing anything he wanted to with a camera on his hands. For those who think Lynch is just a pretentious guy which only films nonsenses, please take a look at this movie.As for John Hurt, he didn't need to become the elephant man to demonstrate he's one of the best actors of his generation; nevertheless, he accepted the challenge... and he won. He made an outrageous display of physical and mental effort, and of body talk. I can't imagine how hard it was for him to carry that disguise all along the whole filming. Please let's take our hats off to Mr. John Hurt.The Elephant Man, just an essential film.*My rate: 10/10
Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it's credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it's title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that's all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that's all it needs, so that's all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.The film is also ironic. Aside from it's visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus. The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he's had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society's upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends. The Elephant Man is not merely a horror story of the life of a very unfortunate man; it's a story of love, a story of acceptance. Despite being taken from one circus to another, the Elephant Man is happier and more fulfilled than he ever was; he doesn't care about the looks and the exploitation, he merely wants to be loved. By 'normal' people, this is taken for granted; but The Elephant Man shows us that love and acceptance isn't something that can be taken for granted. As one doctor notes in the film, "we can't imagine the life he's had". We can't.David Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience. Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him. With this, David Lynch makes a mockery out of today's society, without ever making a mockery out of the character upon which this film is based. The Elephant Man himself is a perfectly balanced example of how pathos can be achieved. Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also. With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.To put it simply: David Lynch has taken a story that could have easily been told simply and expanded it to take in themes that are outside of the central premise. This small story of one unfortunate man has been moulded into a striking comment on society. And all in all; it's a masterpiece.
very disturbing. Anthony Hopkins, as Dr. Treaves, trying to help a disfigured patient in the Victorian Era. The really sad part is that this was based on a true story.John Hurt is very effective, and the cinematography seems even more graphic in black and white. Sadly the carnival and freak-show atmosphere was prevalent in those days for entertainment. Today we have reality TV.Anyone who has traveled and visited the "surgical theaters" of Victorian England will be interested in this story. The Anthony Hopkins character has redeeming values, and the story is a case everyone should be made aware of.The atmosphere is foreboding and scary. Man's inhumanity to man. 10/10.
I just watched this movie last night and i must say... it touched me in a way no other movie has... some of the scenes even brought me to tears, which has never happened to me before.... John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes....
but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time "I pray to god that he's an idiot", sadly, he is everything but that...10/10, no question
With a crowd bearing down on him, the tortured cry of The Elephant Man (John Hurt) rings out: "I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being!"Set in Victorian England, it looks into the Freak Show trade that was popular then, through one particular gentleman, grossly and uniquely deformed, by the name of John Merrick (The Elephant Man), and is based on the memoirs of the doctor played by Anthony Hopkins, Dr Frederick Treves. It shows the humanity of poor Mr Merrick and condemns the society that exploited him for its own monetary gain and sick pleasure.The story itself is a difficult one, and i'm surprised that any producer, even someone as offbeat as Mel Brooks, would have agreed to pour money into this idea. It has none of the classic elements of the commercial formula for making a movie that will make money: it has no love story, it has no sex, and, without spoiling too much, it is quite a tragic, unhappy story.The pervasive tragedy of the story is that John Merrick is an intelligent man, trapped inside this hideously misshapen body. Hanging over the head of the story is also the fact that nothing can be done for Mr Merrick. And the metaphor running throughout is that Merrick is no elephant man at all, he's just as human as the rest of us, but this exhibitionist, heartless society whipped him and made him dance around for them like an elephant in a circus tent."Luck, my friend," A circus dwarf says to the elephant man at one point in the story, "and who needs it but we."It is a story of immense sensitivity and humanity, and one the likes of which you won't see anywhere else. Its definitely not for the weak-hearted or depressed. Its often devastatingly difficult to watch (mainly in one or two scenes), most of this story is wildly compelling and human drama due to the immense talents of Lynch and Hopkins in particular. There are certainly moments of reprieve - all is not black.Its certainly a beautiful movie - every frame is perfection. Gorgeous black and white cinematography give this subject the class it deserves. A wonderful score by John Morris helps give it a haunting beauty. It is directed with superb classical storytelling, illustrated by Lynchian brushstrokes: expressionistic dream sequences and trademark Lynchian soundtrack. David Lynch should be very proud of this early effort. It is a marvellous film. The sensitivity of the construction, and its classic perfection, are the work of a master.But it is hard to say what this movie would be without Anthony Hopkins. It is a topic that easily could have fallen into the trap of the society it depicts, of exploiting freaks for the petty thrill of exhibitionism. But whatever credit for this that does not go to Lynch, must go to Hopkins. His sincere delivery, in one of the most genuine performances i've ever seen, are a major factor in our believing this story really happened (which it did), and taking it seriously (which we do).5 stars.
There's always the inclination to say, "My God, how could anyone go wrong with a cast like that?" but of course the list of such disasters is long. This is one of those (few) movies about which, in my opinion, there's just nothing bad to say. The story is true, and John Hurt's incredible make-up corresponds very well to photographs of the real-life "elephant man." Hurt's interplay with Anthony Hopkins carries the film along on the evolution of their relationship from detached scientific fascination to enduring friendship. Ann Bancroft's performance is as masterful as one would hope and expect. The interviews included on the DVD were worth watching too, and will add to appreciation of the next viewing.
This movie changed my life forever. To see someone so beautiful, dignified, and unique, hidden behind a body and face that society considers ugly, made me realize how the body is a decaying pile of dust, but the soul is a breath-taking and uniquely formed indestructible diamond.I believe that everyone should get a chance to see this film, for those of an open mind, and a caring soul, there is nothing else like it.It also shows the detestable ways some people treat others. I felt at first pity for John Merrick, but then my feelings changed to admiration, as the film went on. John, in the film starts as a severely deformed mute figure being badly mistreated, as the story progresses, he becomes the hero. A bold and courageous man, standing against the  evils of modern society.Joseph (John) Merrick, was a man so one-of-a-kind, that someone else like him physically or emotionally will never appear again. His life should be taken as an example to everyone.As in the film, John's mother says "Nothing will Die", Joseph Merrick will live on in the hearts and souls of everyone who has witnessed the story of his life.My love goes to Joseph Merrick, where ever he may be.
Never could one hope to find a film as ugly and beautiful as David Lynch's film biography of John Merrick (The Elephant Man).  Merrick's story is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking and appalling cases of human injustice to those different, with a strong message, which still holds importance to this day.  In the hands of a lesser talented director this film may have been just another pointless Hollywood story, but in the hands of Lynch the film becomes a haunting, beautiful, but at the same time, highly disturbing work of art.  Always surrealistic in its storytelling approach, the film sets up Merrick's complicated birth with an abstract dream/flash back sequence, dimly lit and photographed in gloriously grainy black and white the audience can't help but be immediately drawn in to the story.The film then jumps forwards, and introduces us to the character of Fredrick Treves (Hopkins) at a London carnival, where Merrick is being shown as part of the sideshow.  Treves is unable to see Merrick due to the police, who close the show before he gets there, but hungry for a glimpse he arranges to for a private showing with Merrick's owner Bytes.  Lynch is reluctant to show us Merrick in full daylight for the first quarter of the film, which in my opinion was a clever move, because it allows we the audience to share Treve's intrigue as to weather or not the tag Elephant Man is suited, or whether we are being duped into seeing something not too much out of the ordinary.  It is only later that, after we see Merrick, we realise that he is truly deformed beyond human recognition.The next part of the film is where the real argument of The Elephant Man rests, the age-old argument of beauty only being skin deep and how those who have beauty on the outside often have none on the inside.  As Merrick goes to show the staff of the hospital of which he's taken residency that he is an articulate, erudite human being, he is slowly integrated into polite society, not from respect though, the crowds are only gathering because viewing Merrick has become something of a status symbol, and this is where Treve's must decide whether or not he has forced John to exchange one freak-show for another.  For me The Elephant Man is one of the most staggering and moving films of recent cinema, the herald of a maverick talent in the then young David Lynch, and brimming with evocative production design, beautiful photography and a wealth of fine performances from Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud and Michael Elphick, not to mention Hurt's remarkable performance hidden under layers of prosthetic make-up.  It is true what others have said, that The Elephant Man is a very bleak, very downbeat film, a film not afraid to hold a mirror to society's injustices, but the ending is uplifting in a different way than most conventional happy endings.  In the respect that John has just has the happiest day of his life, and no day will ever be that good, so the perfect way to end that perfect day, is to sleep like he has always wanted to, even if it will result in his own death.  With the final line (used as my summary), we are told that nothing dies, that the spirit will always live on.  What a touching sentiment to the endurance of the human spirit.  A masterpiece 10/10
this is a brilliantly done film.  it is quite raw and blunt about its subject matter, however, so it should not be viewed for "entertainment" purposes, thought he story is inherently intriguing.  we must just sit and watch in curiousity and amazement, but in concurrence with extreme sorrow, as we are shown the brutality that john merrick must face as his reality.  a smile from another human being, or even a pleasant greeting (which is something that we all take for granted), is treated by this man as the highest form of complimentary behavior possible.one of the best films that i have ever seen.  it wouldnt be called a top 25 of all-time film by the public (though i may place it there), however, based solely on the fact that it, as i mentioned earlier, is lacking in terms of typical "entertainment" value.  even though you will certainly be immersed the entire way through. ah, who knows! im not expressing myself very well. make it a priority to see this film. enjoyabsolutely amazing and memorable - 10/10
It is truly baffling to me that there are people who have seen this film  who still think that David Lynch is a cold and cruel film-maker. David Lynch is ,in fact, a man of extraordinary gentleness and sensitivity, who cares deeply about the sort of people whom mainstream society stigmatizes as 'freaks'.Please, watch this film--watch it carefully-- and you will see that Lynch's deepest concern is with how a over-industrialized, rigid, and profoundly hypocritical society crushes its outsiders. It may sound odd, but I really believe that the non-Christian Lynch has, in the person of John Merrick portrayed one of the most profoundly moving "Christ figures' in all of film.  Let me also note how well Lynch( In only his second effort at directing!) handled such legends as Hiller, Gielgud and Hopkins.
THE ELEPHANT MAN is a powerful and moving story with incredible performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Based on a true story, the movie is about John Merrick, a horrifically deformed man who Anthony Hopkins' character (Frederick Treeves) finds as a sideshow freak in a carnival. Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye. I'll be honest, I cried on more than one occasion, and this has to be one of the most emotionally powerful movies I've ever seen. Family-friendly, has a great message and highly recommended for anyone.
'I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am a man!'John Merrick (as portrayed in The Elephant Man)'If Your Life Sucks, Watch this Movie' 'The Elephant Man,' directed by David Lynch and written by Sir Frederick Treves and Ashley Montagu, is a macabre story about Dr. Frederick 'Freddie' Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who shows compassion for a man with Proteous Syndrome John Merrick (John Hurt). The story is based on the true account of John Merrick's life as a side show freak in the nineteenth century. The viewer is taken on a journey of a man trying to regain some self-respect and the doctor who is helping him to do so.If you are like me and in a bad space in your life, watch this movie. Although a depressing film there are brief moments of hope with the interaction of Merrick and Treves. But, mostly it is scene after scene of abuse, torture and the dark side of human nature. This is not a movie that a viewer is going to want to watch time and time again. Watching this movie is like being drug through a crime scene, most don't want to look but most can't help themselves. After viewing the film, I felt a lot better about my life, and right now I am unemployed, fat and alone.That being said, the movie taken as a work of art was excellent. The black and white cinematography really added to the Victorian feel of the nineteenth century. The character development was superb and the acting of Hopkins and Hurt phenomenal. The makeup and costuming was dark as the film itself and the direction by Lynch, using his signature 'dream' scenes only added to the dimness of the entire film. I highly recommend this film once because it is beautifully directed and a great story. But, unless you are a masochist, once is enough.
In memory of Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890).The movie is Joseph Merrick's story who became known as The Elephant Man. This is one of the saddest movies I have ever seen and yet it is so good. My heart goes out to Merrick - he had to endure so much in his life.The Elephant Man is filmed in black and white - which is perfect for the film. The black and white gives the viewer a feeling of being a much older film than it actually is. It also has a feeling of being a classic horror movie - which works perfectly for the story because Joseph Merrick's condition is horrifying yet his story is so beautiful, touching and sad.A great film.9/10
I first saw The Elephant Man at its pre-release showing in 1980, and it struck an immediate and resonant chord with me.  Few movies are like this, and it remains (many viewings later) one of my top 10 films of all time.The plot is presented well in other reviews here, so I will not repeat it or comment further.  Of the film itself I would only add that it is without doubt the most mature and satisfying of David Lynch's works - in many ways it is the final, polished jewel carved from the rough and ugly (but fascinating) diamond of Eraserhead, with the self-conscious artiness and juvenile qualities of the earlier film distilled into a potent and poignant statement on the human condition.Some critics have dismissed The Elephant Man as an exercise in emotional manipulation, however I believe this completely misses the point.  All films are manipulative to some degree, but it is a manipulation in which we as an audience engage by consent.  The Elephant Man will stand the final test and it will be appreciated fully by future audiences, in much the same way as Citizen Kane had to wait for some decades until audiences  were able to fully comprehend its greatness.
The Elephant Man is truly a moving story that is earnest and throughout the film, it makes the point that humans are not animals, no matter the dysfunctions or handicaps. In the case of John Merrick, he is revolting to look at because of an terrible accident, but he makes clear to all the people wanting to use him or gape at him, he is a human just like the rest of them. No matter who you are, it will be impossible not to cry at some point. That's how emotionally-affecting this film is.Directed by David Lynch, this is one of his more conventional films, but the subject matter is still very intense. This film is about a surgeon at a London hospital named Frederick Treves who discovers a "freak" named John Merrick and he rescues Merrick from a freakshow, thus allowing Merrick to live at the hospital and have a life of his own.The acting is excellent. John Hurt delivers a stirring performance as Merrick. I was not able to recognize underneath all that makeup, but he delivers a tour de force performance. Anthony Hopkins also does a really good job as the first man to have truly shown Merrick kindness.Overall, The Elephant Man is a film that believe that all people should be treated equally, no matter what he or she looks like. From a technical standpoint, this film is excellent. I liked how it was filmed in black and white because it captures the essence of the Victorian era. A really emotional film and while it's really sad, there are glimmers of hope here shown by Merrick. This is very fine filmmaking. I rate this film 9/10.
I see lots of films, and have a "Top Ten" list that only the most incredible of movies can enter.  However, upon seeing Elephant Man for the first time, it immediately broke onto that list which is dominated by Sci-Fi "guy" movies.The reason is that this movie is so heartbreaking, so sad, and yet so full of hope, there is little you can do to hold back your emotions while watching it.  I recommend watching it alone, for two reasons: 1) it is very painful and sad to watch and 2) the value is lost if you are trying "not to cry" or have something else on your mind (like talking to your friend).The performances are very well done, by Hurt, Hopkins, and everyone else in the cast.  The only gripe I have isn't really a gripe - the film isn't 100% true.  But it will make you forget all your problems for a while. Witnessing the life of "John Mellick" makes your own life seem like paradise.Even after repeated viewings this movie loses NONE of it's impact. Paramount, please release it on DVD!
David Lynch is a remarkable director and The Elephant Man is a remarkable film. Inspired by a true story in the streets of London during the Victorian Age, the film is based entirely around the life of John Merrick (John Hurt), an individual dubbed by his `owner' Bytes (Freddie Jones) and others as 'The Elephant Man' because of his hideous deformities. With this film, Lynch grasps his audience and stretches them to a new parallel of an emotionally capturing film. And what makes this so daunting and so intriguing is the fact that 'The Elephant Man' is a true story, no part of it is fictional. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, the man who somewhat saves John from those who persecute him for being a freak, being a `monster.' A story of human triumph could never be so remarkable as that of The Elephant Man. Lynch takes The Elephant Man to a new level of technical aspiration with a dark, dank setting shot completely in black and white. This film is amazing and would undoubtedly be just okay any other way. The black and white adds to the story in a way that touches the audience much deeper and much more personal. Not to mention stunning performances and dialogue by all cast, `David Lynch's portrait of John 'The Elephant Man' Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.' Literary critic Leslie Fiedler maintains that freaks stir `both supernatural terror and natural sympathies' because they `challenge conventional boundaries between male and female, sexed and sexless, animal and human, large and small, self and other.' In this very interesting and moving film, we are challenged to clarify our values in regard to `very special people.' However, in one powerful scene of tension and curiosity, John Merrick screams out, `I am not an animal! I am a human being! I.am.a man!' This particular sequence, I believe, is incredible and it ties in with the whole focus of the film itself, human dignity and emotion. David Lynch is known for some pretty twisted films, and yet, The Elephant Man is not that twisted at all. Even though his audience views John Merrick as not the average person because of his medical condition, the story is cherished because of how it is put onto the big screen. Compared to his other films such as Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is more surreal in terms of what Lynch was going for. Lynch does a magnificent job in portraying his version of The Elephant Man, and many people along with critics alike agree. I can easily rate The Elephant Man with four stars because David Lynch deserves no less. The Elephant Man is a classic, a striking and devastating film depicting the account of John Merrick's search for a dignified and normal life. I would definitely recommend this film to those in search of a wonderful story about one man's conquest to a regular life. Dr. Treves' account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, but also takes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life is full because I know I am loved.' With such an inspirational and true story, David Lynch puts on a film that should be loved by many, if not all.
I'm not writing any more plaudits for this movie, for most everything has been said about it before. Even a quarter century later, I weep everytime I watch Mr. Hurt and Mr. Hopkins in their roles. The great humanity of David Lynch and the producers has left us with an equally frightening and endearing vision of Mr. Merick.Sadly, there will always be elephant men, as long as ignorance and the impulse for destruction rule men and their domain.
DUNE is an odd film.  After having watched it several times over the years, I'm not afraid to call it a very flawed classic.  That sounds strange, but it fits for this movie.  Lynch got so many things right, but in the end the shortcomings of trying to squeeze an epic story into a little over 2 hours was simply too daunting a challenge.  Besides, I'm sure many went into the theatre expecting a film in the vein of STAR WARS.  DUNE is not a story with which one can delve into brainless.  It does require thought, for it's inaccurate to portray it as anything less than a thinking person's story.  It's not space battles, laser-gun shootouts, funny aliens, etc. There's nothing wrong with those things, it's just not what DUNE is about.  It touches on everything from politics, religion, ecology, the true power of the human mind and will when fully realized, God, etc. Some heady stuff.  So imagine trying to fit all that in a movie.  Lynch got the feel, the imagery down, but wasn't able to cohesively bring the story around w/o really making it a Cliff Notes version of the story. You get the main gist, but don't get the "full story", the themes, etc.  So in the end it does disappoint because you're left  wondering what may have been had the movie conventions of that time  allowed for a 2 or even 3 movie epic.  Oh wait, STAR WARS did that.  I guess DUNE wasn't viewed as bankable enough to make such an investment.Anyway, I still like the film a lot.  The visual realization by Lynch makes it a classic in my book, too bad it couldn't be matched by an equally strong script. I wonder if Peter Jackson would be willing to tackle another 3 film epic? Hmmmmmm.....
To begin with, I have to say that I saw the movie first, and read the book years later. This seems to be important: Nearly everybody who read the book first hates the movie, but most of those who saw the movie first seem to like it.Now, why is this so? I cannot really understand it because, in comparition to other movies based on existing literature, what we have here is a film which stays very close to the original story and does not add many new elements.When I read the book, I could see the movie in front of me in nearly every chapter. So I really don't understand what Herbert-Fans had expected from this movie...I for my part like it a lot. It has a very mystical atmosphere about it and the story develops nicely. Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing, but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies, so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music (which played in my mind all the time while I read the book), and I think the characters are very strong and (for example Letho Atreides) sometimes full of tragedy.The part I like the most though is the worm-part. I think the special effects are not always brilliant, but seeing the scenes with the worms, I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.All in all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack. And I would love to see a Director's Cut version.
First off, an honest confession, I went to the cinema, expecting to be seeing the new film, when the credits rolled, it was this, the original adaptation.Some time since I've seen it, but I still have the same opinions as I did when I first saw it.It's a heavy film, you do need to be a sci-fi enthusiast to enjoy this, partly because of content, partly because of the long running time.I'll start with my favourite aspect, the visuals, absolutely breathtaking, it is a dazzling watch, the sets and costumes are tremendous, the scale of it is hugely impressive, a big supporting cast, it really is a masterpiece, visually. Sure some of the special effects are a little dated now, but that's expected.The story, I have read the book, so I understand the complexities of it, for a novice it can be a challenge, but it may be worth checking out the synopsis before you watch it.The acting, is somewhat varied, I still regard the powerhouse performance as being the one from Sian Phillips, who of course plays The Reverend Mother, she is fabulous, and has heaps of stage presence.I am not sure I have ever fully appreciated just how good an actress Francesca Annis is, talk about a true screen beauty, her presence is huge here, such a beautiful woman.This has given me an even greater appetite to see the new one, however, this remains a classic, it still has the capacity to shock, it definitely still entertains, 8/10.
Say what you will about incoherence, this is more sensuous than any Star Wars. In fact, it is the most expensive 'tripping' ever produced in film - though far from the most satisfying.It helps to know the book and forget it as you watch this. Not being familiar with the book, you're left with a disjointed tapestry of weird costumes and special effects, some of them impressive, but if you are, and don't have to burden yourself with following the constantly clumsy explanation of the multifaceted Dune universe, you can enjoy this as illustration of a few core ideas.Herbert's novel was the product of strange and powerful times. The US public was experiencing the Civil Rights upheaval, its short-lived infatuation with Islam and meditation, and the same year as the book came out, LSD had spilled out of some top-secret government labs into the streets and youth culture of San Francisco. The first satellite images of Earth had just been published. The Black Panthers had entered the vernacular.So all the stuff about prescient visions, mentats and mastering mind, (herbally) expanded consciousness as the tool to the navigation and 'folding' of space, Herbert wrote with one eye on the Jordan Belson, Beatles and Maharishi crowd - the generation between film noir and Lucas that for a brief time projected truths into constructed cosmologies.Herbert was more erudite than most. But he was caught under the same spell - the expectation of a noble jihad of the people and wise lamas from the East coming to teach 'the way'. And you can tell that he was exposed to Eastern thought through Jungians, by his laboriously constructed mythology and (now trite) focus on a Chosen One's journey.Lynch was a late bloomer in that scene. To my knowledge, he fell in with what was being marketed as 'transcendental meditation' in his AFI years, while filming Eraserhead. I don't know what they practice behind closed doors - my interest lies with the Chinese model and they seem cultish to me. But, there's no doubt to me that he passed on the Lucas gig, thinking he was going to work on a vision of some power.The film outright fails because the scope of the book is too big (to think that Hobbit is being stretched into a trilogy these days), and because he lacked the right collaborators and probably the predisposition to make an 'action' Dune.Now Jodorowsky's Dune would have been something to see, probably as cumbersome about spirituality but much more organic. But, it's worth noting a few interesting things about this, in context of how Lynch would expand in later years.He zeroes in on the transcendental experience of 'awakening the sleeper'. He does so in an obvious manner. Rambaldi's spiceworms as blossoming desert flowers top his visual meditation. And that all of Herbert's pomp and mythological noise work against him submerging the idea.Keep in mind the Chinese notion - from the Tao Te Ching - that the 'soft beats the hard', stressed twice in the film even though no one actually thinks or fights in the Chinese way. Discard everything that is hard, from the crass Harkonnen to the acting style (mentat Dourif!) to the sophomoric rousing of Fremen rebellion, laser battles and final redemption.The one part that is soft is at House Atreides, the preparation for Dune. What is there? Familiar dynamics - it's soap opera if you discard the costumes. Premonitions of murder and telepathic wiring with a fabric behind reason. A woman with her box of illusory sensations. A space flight through the doors of perception.It's heady. None of it really works, because Herbert's synchretic universe is not one of internal martial arts, what we see matters. But does any of it remind you of a David Lynch film you know?
There are two groups of people who write at IMDb, the pessimists and the optimists. The pessimists love to complain about something or other in a film. The optimists try and find something good. DUNE probably ranks as one of those that feels like it's going to be good, but leaves a confusing, lackluster feeling in its wake. In an attempt to be optimistic, I will try focusing ONLY on the good parts. This might be tough.I will give David Lynch credit (indeed, as Frank Herbert did when he saw this) for trying to take an enormous amalgamation of things and ideas from the novel and trying to turn them into a movie. Lynch's visual style is very raw here and everything in the production design seems to be under his spell.The sets, costumes, cinematography, and choice of cast is excellent. All of them lend a flavor of difference that transcends whatever confusion is on the screen. (On the side note: I was sick of hearing Kyle MacLachlan repeating himself over and over) The creature designs by Carlo Rambaldi are very Lynch-ien, even though we rarely get to see them.
Overall, a sci-fi epic that requires a lethargic butt, an open mind, and a copy of Frank Herbert's novel to enjoy. Still, it is far superior to the TV miniseries of late (I know saying that is blasphemy to some). I refuse to rate this with stars or anything else.
Dune (1984) is a movie I recently watched again for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an evil emperor who takes advantage of a planets inhabitants and takes their resources to fuel space travel. When the son of a new leader of the planet sees the ways of the local people he decides to join them to overthrow the emperor.This movie is directed by David Lynch (Mulholland Drive) and stars Kyle MacLachlan (Show Girls), Virginia Madsen (Candyman), Leonardo Cimino (Monster Squad), Francesca Annis (Krull), Brad Dourif (Child's Play), Everett McGill (Silver Bullet), Patrick Stewart (X-man) and Sting (Cold Mountain).The storyline for this is very intricate and contains great characters, setting and circumstances that really capture the imagination. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects are way better than they should be for 1984. I am always thoroughly impressed by the space special effects, the worms and the sets. They paid so much attention to detail on the makeup, attire and various props.This really was a great movie. There's a lot to absorb and keep up with, but this is definitely worth your time. This is a science fiction masterpiece that I would strongly recommend and score a 9/10.
I first saw this in the late 80s n found it to be a confusing mess cos of not having read the books but still found it action packed.Revisited it recently after hating the new version cos of its boredom n lack of action.Well, none of em is closer to the books (having read the books now) but this older version shud be applauded for being a bit entertaining n having a big star cast for those days.Was a bit disappointed to see the hottie Virginia Madsen in a tiny role.
My review covers both versions of Dune, the 2 hour release and the extended 3 hour "Smithee" version aired on television. The first cut of the film was over four hours long, but there was never any intention to release this, and Lynch himself shot scenes which consolidated the final product into a more manageable length.Allen Smithee, a protest pseudonym adopted by Lynch when he disassociated himself with the 3 hour version of this film, is also alluded to in Lynch's latest film - Inland Empire. A portion of a film studio in Inland Empire is "Smithee's Room" - a metaphorical insight into Lynch's feelings about Dune, and studio-controlled film-making in general.Given the tremendous investment made by the studio, Lynch's general distaste for the final product, the repetitive cliché soundtrack, and the occasionally bizarre use of voice-over narrative in the TV version, it seems more a DeLaurentis film than a Lynch film. Although I am very interested in Lynch's films and other projects, I am evaluating this solely from my own perspective. Despite the great director's poor opinion of this film, I enjoyed it and it is one of my favorite sci-fi films. Frank Herbert, author of the novel upon which it is based, approved the theatrical version, but he had the benefit of knowing what he was going to see. If you haven't read the book, these films can be somewhat difficult to understand. And if you come to the experience expecting something like Star Wars, you should probably find something else to do.The soundtrack is repetitive and only interesting the first time you hear the film's major theme (the Eno composition). The use of rock orchestration simply does not work in this film. Happily, Lynch learned from the experience and used rock instrumentation beautifully in later films (especially Wild at Heart and Lost Highway). The camera work is generally less inspired than the rest of Lynch's portfolio. There are occasional visually striking scenes which will remind you of the film's origin, but there are too many static shots - especially during the action scenes. The soundtrack is easy to explain - like the inclusion of Sting in the cast - this is a marketing move by the production company, not a creative choice of the director. The camera work is much less easily explained. Perhaps Lynch was asked to avoid doing anything surreal or bizarre with this film (sort of like asking Groucho Marx to avoid being funny), or the studio was trying to appeal to fans of Star Wars by simplifying and sterilizing its story.The recently released special edition DVD reveals some very interesting aspects of the production. Lynch's influence, not surprisingly, is best explored in the short documentary concerning the film's design. As an artist, Lynch spent a great deal of time and energy envisioning the material culture  both historical and modern  of each culture depicted in the film, helping to create a consistent and unique characterization for each. This spilled over quite naturally into costume design. The sets and costumes used in this film are really spectacular. The special effects, often derided by contemporary viewers, required a great deal more effort that the synthetic art of today's computerized extravaganzas and, the documentary concerning their production on the DVD is also appropriately respectful.What you will see is an intense visualization of several, fully realized alien cultures whose art, architecture and general heritage are as well realized, if not more so, than in Herbert's epic novel. To fully appreciate this, don't just check out the extras on the DVD, turn down the sound and just watch the sets, costumes, and effects move through each scenes. There is, as with Lynch's entire portfolio, a great deal to be seen. And the acting and direction are fine throughout the film.The longer version fleshes out the stories, themes and intricate subplots of Herbert's book more thoroughly, and maintains a much steadier pace than the cinematic release. Even so, both films, to some extent, suffer from too much story, overwhelming visualization, and a un-Lynchian frenetic pace. The later TV mini-series by the sci fi channel does a better job of telling the story in its entirety, but runs about 246 minutes and does not compare to the original in terms of design. Lynch's cinematic release, by contrast, rushes through components of the book and often feels inconsistent in pace.PLOT: Dune is the story of Paul "Muad'ib" Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides the Just and his Bene Jesserat concubine Lady Jessica. Combining aspects of fantasy, sci-fi and anthropology, the story follows young Paul through a series of tragedies which find him seeking redemption for an entire galaxy by leading an adoptive tribal culture to a revolutionary cleansing of the malignant imperial system from which he sprung. The plot is exceedingly complex  in both Lynch versions of the film much is left out of Herbert's original work. Subplots abound, but, true to form, Lynch avoids short-cuts as much as possible and attempts to show his audience what is going on rather than resorting to a great deal of voice-over narrative in the theatrical release. The TV version, however, attempts to provide even more detail, and uses voice-over to patch up the areas glossed over by Lynch's script.SUMMARY: If you're a Lynch fan and not a big Herbert fan or you don't have a great deal of patience, see the cinematic release. It is the class of the lot.If you haven't read the book, or you are a Herbert purist who will accept only what was written, choose the Sci-Fi Channel version (review forthcoming soon) - but be forewarned - it is very long.If you want something that compromises between story and cinematic artistry, go for the TV version. The weakest link, but still OK.
An early David Lynch film adapting a Frank Herbert novel of the same name. Taking place in the distant future, it depicts young Paul Atreides's (Kyle MacLachlan) journey as his family takes up position as the rulers of the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, source of the drug melange, catalyst of space travel and source of eternal youth.The original book is one of the great works of science fiction, still very popular even today and hauled as a masterpiece. It's a meditation on power, when and how to wield it and whether or not it should be wielded. It's also an epic in every meaning of the word.And while Lynch's adaptation suffers somewhat due to limitations of the budget and the state of special effects at the time of its making, it's still more than valiant attempt. I especially like MacLachlan as Paul and Francesca Annis as Lady Jessica, his mother.Then again, the rivals of Paul and his family, the Harkonnens, are way over the top goofy, whereas in the book they're coldblooded killers and menace beyond reason.Likewise it's a tad weird to have Toto, the band, providing the soundtrack, but I can't say I minded it.Not a perfect adaptation by any means, and I'd hazard that it'd be a bit difficult to follow if you haven't read the book, but even still it's pretty epic in its own right.
There are some good parts in David Lynch's much maligned version of Frank Herbert's famous novel but they are few and far between. The main score is generally excellent (except when it pointlessly switches to dated '80's guitar rock), some of the images of the endless deserts of Arrakis are quite well done, and, although primitive and simplistic by modern standards, the early use of CGI in the shielded fight scenes should be lauded. Unfortunately these plusses are greatly outweighed by the film's deficits. The producers seemed to have little faith in the actors, so almost every action is accompanied by an explanatory voice representing of the person's thoughts. Some of the acting, especially the various villainous Harkonnens, is awful. The novelty-casting of Sting as Feyd-Rautha doesn't help: he spends too much time trying to look evil by smirking and fiddling with a knife but whatever menace he establishes is quickly undone when he steps out of the steam-bath in leather pampers. Kyle MacLachlan, who plays the central character Paul Atreides, generally looks uncomfortable and out of place, which is not helped by the constant melodramatic voiceovers. Patrick Stewart's Gurney Halleck is good (although why he has to carry the little dog is beyond me), as is Max von Sydow who plays Kynes, the exobiologist and honorary Freman who introduces Paul to the desert planet. The special-effects set pieces (especially the sand-worms and the climactic battle) have not aged well and despite some nice 'steam punk' stylings, the film still looks like an overproduced 1980's Italian vision of the future. Lynch has essentially disowned the film as have many fans of the book. I didn't like "Dune" when I first saw it 34 years ago and a recent rewatch on Netflix didn't do much to change my overall opinion. There are rumours that Denis Villeneuve will soon direct a remake and, as there have been some great successes in filming 'unfilmable' books ("The Lord of the Rings" being an obvious example), perhaps the next film will better capture Herbert's stark and lofty vision.
Every time I see this film I like it more, yet can see why people would dislike this movie, and I can sum up it's shortcoming this way:Not close enough to the book to humour the people who have read the book, to confusing for people who have not. Thus Lynch managed to get a lot of bad press about this near masterpiece.It is very difficult to fit the plot of Herbert's masterpiece into 130 minutes, but I think Lynch did a good job, sadly he added som stuff that was not in the book. Where Lynch does excel is in setting the mood. To help him he had probably the best possible cast for such a movie and the best musical score ever. The acting overall is excellent (except possibly Maclachlan and Jones) and for me who read the book before seeing the film, it is hard not to see Stewart as Halleck. The timing of the acting and events is almost perfect. If Lynch had had help by a better scriptwriter to curb some of his wilder additions and flesh out the plot a bit and this could have been one of the best sci-fi movies ever. As is, it is very good, but somewhat flawed.
First of all I've read Herberts Dune saga and I loved the first book (the one the movie is about) and liked the rest.Second there is a difference between the cinema version (137 min) and the TV version (190 min often referred also "special edition") which should also not be confused with the new version from 2000 (Frank Herbert's Dune). To keep it short the 137 version is great and the 190 min version sucks.The TV version was split up to fill 2 evenings. For that they added about an hour of additional material not seen in the original version. While some of it is quite good like the prologue which went a little bit deeper into the Dune universe (Butlers Djihad) but most of it just destroys the atmosphere and the flow of the movie. On the technical side there is to note that the whole movie was Pan-Scanned which never is a good idea. Compared to the original version the quality really blows.Now to the good one:The movie is pretty much faithful to the book. There are things that were cut out from the book or it shows stuff that wasn't there, but what you see is CLEARLY Herbert's book which I thought is nearly impossible to translate into a (good) movie. It translates the "feel" of the book very well to the screen.The most notable differences is that in the book Paul is at the age of 15 (at least at the beginning) while McLachlan more looks like 20 but I can live with that. The rest are minor things (like these sound modules) and some differences in continuity (the navigators needing the spice to well... navigate is revealed at the beginning).The all actors give a solid performances. Notable are Kenneth McMillan (Baron Harkonnen) Patrick "Captain Picard" Steward (Gurney Halleck) and Sting as Feyd Rautha which really add to the movie.The special effects range from crappy to good. The movie shines where it 's most important namely the sand worms which look fairly convincing. Personally I prefer (well done) miniature shots over those Episode 1/2 CGI effects which make especially environments look like plastic.I think everybody who calls himself a Science-Fiction fan should have seen this movie which is a jewel under all those mediocre films that were spawned by Star Wars at that time. All the fans of the book should see it as what it is: A movie based on Dune. If you want the book word by word, don't watch the movie and read the book again.
Seriously, I do not understand why so many people dislike this movie. I think you have to take a couple of things into account. First: It is a 2 hour movie telling a story that spans several hundred pages in a book - so certain losses are just natural. Second: Compared to three times recycled multi-million-dollar-trash like the new Star Wars Episodes, this movie offers something really unique: A style of its own. The mixture between scifi elements, medieval setting and the culture of the the Middle East is excellent and Lynch welded them together into one solid piece of art... even though he seems to disagree today. Within this setting the lack of non-stop-action or overwhelming SFX never bothered me. On the contrary, this movie gives you time to watch... and many scenes are worth a second look. Third: I loved the actors, who were just as stiff, ugly, arrogant, noble or nice like the characters they tried to represent.In the end it is a question of taste if you like this movie or not. But for me, it will always have a place in my DVD-shelf...
I was in high school when this was released. I didn't read the book, but older friends in our group knew about this story in detail. They sort of liked it, while I liked it. I thought it was different. It is a precursor to The 5th Element and similar movies. It's odd and unique.I still haven't read the book, but I've seen the other versions of this story. The five part series twenty years ago had more detail. So I am thinking that with all the material they had to shorten the movie and that meant scenes were cut out.I still find this enjoyable even after 30+ years. The cast is good, the music/score, the direction, the effects. I don't know why people hate it so much.
'Dune' may have a dated look due to the poor special effects but it still is an enjoyable adventurous science fiction movie. The film is awkward and feels a little rushed but the sense of adventure is well maintained. Lynch fans who haven't yet seen this movie might be disappointed because this isn't like any of his later works. Almost everything about it, except for some of the acting is over the top. But it feels like a science fiction movie because of the unusual names, the art direction etc. With the excessive use of CGI, it is nowadays sometimes difficult with science fiction movies to feeling the experience of the world the director creates. It was fun to see actors like Kyle Machlachlan, Sean Young and Virginia Madsen who were so young at the time. 'Dune' has its flaws and there are many of it but the idea behind it is creative and the film has heart to make it entertaining enough. It is certainly not among the best of its genre and nor Lynch's best but it's fun enough to roll along with.
A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis when they assassinate his father and free their desert world from the emperor's rule.The general consensus is that this is not a good movie. But the general consensus is apparently wrong, because it has a decent rating on IMDb. And, in fact, it is a very enjoyable film and a great adaptation of the novel. On top of that, Lynch was great with his casting choices. Brad Dourif? Perfect! And even Sting.The version I watched ran just over two hours. Another version runs longer than three hours. Whether this would be even better or be too much is not known to me. I would certainly be interested in checking that version out.
For a movie from the 80's it has very good special effects.The script of this movie can be confusing and heavy for some people but for me it results in a complex story full of emotions, I love how it handles the story so fast, the special effects are good, it has good photography and it has good acting. The reason for some things that happen is not explained, there is no plot to follow and some things are not resolved.For me it works well and although it can start with a slow pace, then the pace of the film is much more dynamic, it is a very good science fiction film with some negative things but it is still enjoyable.
Over the years, I have come to the understanding that there are two schools of though here. Some people absolutely hate this movie and other absolutely love it. I'm of the latter school, regularly enjoying Lynch's twisted take on the late Herbert's fantastic story. The story follows the House Atreides on a planetary move to the spice mining world of Arakis. With it, comes the power struggle and life and death situations commonly associated with political struggle. Dark and interesting, Lynch has managed to capture all of Herbert's story and mix it with some of his sick and twisted ideas. A must watch for Lynch and Herbert fans.8/10
It's the year 10,191. The universe is ruled by Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth. The most precious substance is the spice, melange which is used to extend life and fold space. It only exists on Arrakis also known as Dune where the local Fremen long for a prophesized messiah. The emperor plans to dethrone Duke Leto Atreides (Jürgen Prochnow) fearing his new weapon, the weirding module. First he allows the House Atreides to run the spice production. Then he supports the jealous House Harkonnen to invade and kill all the Atreides. There is something about Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) that concerns everybody. He and his mother Lady Jessica manage to escape the massacre. They find shelter with the Fremen as he falls in love with Chani (Sean Young).There is a dense introduction and lots of expositions. It is way too complicated for novices on the first try. I'm sure many people glazed over. The style is impressive. It has a great unique look. The production value is all there on the screen. The cast is also impressive with some strange outsider casting like Sting, a whole lot of experience, and some newcomers who would become big stars. They all work in their own way. David Lynch is definitely going all in with this movie. It has its Lynch weirdness but he holds it back enough to allow the story to make some sense. The weirdness sometimes works but sometimes pumps up the cheese factor. It just won't make sense to most people who haven't read the books. It's probably a movie that is too ambitious to work completely. It's also way too melodramatic at times. It works better after a couple of viewings to understand what's going on.
If you're a fan of Frank Herbert's novel (And I am. It's my favorite novel of all-time), chances are you're going to find a lot to complain about when it comes to writer/director David Lynch's controversial 1984 film adaptation. Not the minor tweaks, inevitable omissions and odd aesthetic choices, I'm talking fundamental changes to the heart and the subtext of the story. But despite this, I adore this film. Is it a good adaptation of 'Dune'? No. It's not the dropped characters, like the Fenrings, or reduced or totally omitted story lines, such as Thufar Hawat's time among the Harkonnens (Though, because it's Lynch, we do get Hawat having to milk a hairless cat). Or even the fact that the bulk of Paul's time with the Fremen is told in montage form. It's turning Paul into an actual deity, without all of the subtext of religious manipulation.But, if you choose to view the film on its own terms and in the context that Lynch presents it, I still believe it works exceptionally well as a piece of epic space opera. With some incredible design work, an amazing score (By the rock band Toto!?--with an additional track by Brian Eno!?) and a cast who absolutely inhabit their roles, 'Dune' is, in my humble opinion at least, a flawed masterpiece.
"Dune" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a young man going to another planet in order to lead some warriors against the galactic emperor and free them from him. He has to become who they want and need him to be.I liked this movie because it had a nice and interesting plot that combined very well action with drama. The direction which was made by David Lynch was very good and he presented very well both his main characters and their history along with many information regarding the universe of the future. The interpretations of Kyle MacLachlan who played as Paul Atreides, Kenneth McMillan who played as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, José Ferrer who played as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and Virginia Madsen who played as Princess Irulan were very good and they all did their best. To sum up, I have to say that "Dune" is a nice and entertaining Sci-Fi movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy it.
This film's only redeeming quality is the original score by Toto. The music, at least some of it, is appropriately celestial, ethereal, almost subliminal in its orchestration. That said, the film's other elements are awful.The plot is an incoherent mess. I had no idea what was going on. After the first thirty minutes, I really didn't care what was going on. Character and place names confuse and irritate; they are like something from out of a witch's dictionary. The characters are uninteresting, and I could not identify with any of them. They have no sense of humor, and always seem to be in a bad mood. (Whatever happened to antidepressants?). The dialogue is heavy duty, melodramatic mumbo jumbo. The voice-over technique is overused, and is therefore irritating. The casting is poor. Kyle MacLachlan is not convincing in the role he plays, because he lacks charisma. The worms have no personality. The special effects are mediocre at best. And the film is full of cheap cinematic gimmicks, like blue eyeballs, futuristic techno-gadgets, and a floating fat man.It is a dreadfully pretentious and ponderous film that takes itself way too seriously. Even Ed Wood's "Plan 9 From Outer Space" has some entertainment value, derived from its technical crudeness. But, apart from portions of the soundtrack, "Dune" has no entertainment value of any kind. The film is cold and clammy. It has all the charm of a dead fish.
I have a lot of difficulty being critical of movies this visually arresting and adventurous, even if plot/story-wise they are largely just a more confusing mashup of Mad Max and Star Wars. Lynch's Dune is a silly, ambitious mess, but it's far from unwatchable. Despite its reputation, I'm just grateful that the universe gave us David Lynch's version of a blockbuster.
I should have known, and actually did expect that the movie, at a little over three hours, couldn't do justice to the Frank Herbert novel that ran nearly eight hundred pages. This was one of those rare occasions where I recently read the book and called up the movie within a short period of time so that a reasonable comparison could be made. Yes, there were many elements of the novel that appeared in the film, though nearly as many elements that weren't, and merely thrown in to fascinate the viewer. One such was the appearance of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan), portrayed as a floating gas-bag with a face pock-marked with pus filled pimples that made him look grotesque. Or the Mentats, described here as human computers, whereas they were more effectively characterized in the novel as elite assassins. Characters in the novel like Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) had a much larger role in the story that took place, and were much more influential in the mystical development of Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) as the youth who eventually replaced his father to lead the Fremens against the Harkonnens on the planet Arrakis.So it puzzles me to learn that Frank Herbert was actually fond of the David Lynch treatment of his celebrated work, hailed by many as the ultimate work of fantasy fiction. For some, maybe so, but for me it doesn't hold a candle to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and if you extend that argument to cinema, the same holds true. Perhaps the best thing I can say about the movie was it's casting of principal characters. Kyle MacLachlan was a good choice for the role of Paul Atreides, maybe a tad too old to portray a fifteen year old future monarch, but I don't think an actual teenager would have been right to pull off the part. Jose Ferrer imparted the proper gravitas for the Padishah Emperor, and Jürgen Prochnow made for a suitable Duke Leto Atreides. One of the miscasts though had to be Patrick Stewart as Paul's adviser Gurney Halleck, mostly because he didn't have all that much to do and had no impact on the story. There were any number of scenes in which he was left just standing around as part of the scenery.On adapting such a well known and admired book as "Dune", director David Lynch has been quoted as saying, "You've got to be either stupid or crazy to try something like this." With all due respect to someone who's had his share of success in filmdom, a remark like that makes one too easy of a target.
A very strange movie but incredible. A young man (Kyle MacLaclan) comes home to help care for his sick father. Soon he's in love with a detective's daughter (Laura Dern) and mixed up in a mystery involving Dorothy Valdes (Isabella Rossellinni) and psycho Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).Probably David Lynch's best film. The story has gaps in logic, but it's secondary to some incredible wide screen imagery (this has to be seen letter-boxed...no two ways about it). Lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie. You can tell...things that make no sense at first gradually make sense later on. This movie also demands multiple viewings...I was so shocked the first time I saw it, I couldn't concentrate on it...it took THREE viewings to finally get it. As to what the movie is about...it depends who you ask. Some people said it's the Hardy Boys on drugs...others say it's about a boy's sexual awakening...others see it as good vs. evil...each one is a valid statement! To me, that's a true art film...one that means multiple things all at once.The performances are top-notch. This film made MacLachlan...him and Laura Dern work well together and give nice low-key performances. Dern is just great...but she does look pretty silly when she tries to cry. Rossellinni is nowhere near as good as her mother (Ingrid Bergman) was, but she deserves credit for taking such a risky role. She's pretty good. Hopper is WAYYYYYYY over the top as Booth...he's both horrifying and hilarious...a great performance. And let's not forget Dean Stockwell as "suave Ben". His "performance" of "In Dreams" is a definite highlight.Be warned--the film is very extreme. There's explicit violence, plenty of nudity, sex and tons of profanity. Not for the squeamish. Still, I loved it from beginning to end. One of my favorite films of all time.
In the early moments of "Blue Velvet" we see idealized small town images - blooming red roses and immaculate white picket fences - accompanied by the sounds of the gentle Bobby Vinton pop tune that gives the film its title. If you sense something unsettling about this perfection, that's only appropriate. "Blue Velvet" is a David Lynch film, you see, and it won't be long at all before a clean-cut college student comes across a rotting ear in an open field.Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is the boy who finds the ear, and Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) is the blonde policeman's daughter who assists Jeffrey when he decides to investigate the truth about his disturbing discovery. Sandy and Jeffrey link the ear to night club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and later, a deranged man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper)."I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert," Sandy tells Jeffrey when he decides to sneak into Dorothy's apartment. As Jeffrey becomes sexually entangled with Dorothy, we can only cast similar doubt.It's true that "Blue Velvet"'s dark mysteries have the power to repulse. Voyeurism, rape, torture, and murder are all key to the plot. Yet the film is also spellbinding in its beauty. Vibrant colors and ominous shadows offer gorgeous contrast - call it Technicolor noir - and the film is rife with unforgettable imagery. Moments big and small, from MacLachlan playing with a child's birthday hat to Dean Stockwell's show-stopping lip-synch of Roy Orbison's "In Dreams", are as haunting as anything you will see at the movies anywhere.The acting is top-notch. MacLachlan is just right as the lost innocent Jeffrey, and Hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint Frank. Rossellini's performance as Dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous: this is her defining moment as an actress."Blue Velvet" is perhaps the quintesstential David Lynch film. His strange humor and painterly gift for creating stunning images are prominently on display, and the film illustrates Lynch's contradictory impulses toward unbridled nastiness and aw-shucks sweetness like no other has. After all these years, "Blue Velvet" is still a shocker, and deciding how one feels about it is still a challenge. It is a film to be considered and then reconsidered, visited and revisited, the kind of film that will never fade away. For serious cinephiles, then, "Blue Velvet" is a film to be cherished.
This has always been a unique crime movie, like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways, it's a sick film...but utterly fascinating, even after a handful of viewings. It's a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters.This movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen: "Frank Booth," played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here, "Dorothy Vallens," played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.Kyle MacLaclan is good as the nosy late-teen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothy's apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.In a movie that features strange characters, the strangest scene of them - and there are a number - is in Booth's apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwell's lip-synching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake, though: as bizarre as this film can get, it's mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get very uncomfortable to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. He's about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the f-word in about every sentence. He is so over-the-top, though, that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice, I know almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts. Visually and audibly, this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors, creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock 'n roll songs, and a bunch of bizarre noises (sound effects). From discussions I've had, this seems to be a film people love or hate. There is not much room for middle ground. Lynch has done much "nicer" films such as "The Straight Story," crazier films ("Wild At Heart," "Eraserhead") and classier movies ("The Elephant Man") but this will be his trademark film: the one above others he will be remembered for, good or bad.
Jeffrey Beaumont returns to his small town home when his father has an accident and ends up in hospital.  A quiet walk home changes his perceptions forever when he discovers a human ear in the long grass.  He reports it to the police but decides to make some enquires himself with the help of the officer's daughter Sandy.  The trail begins with the mysterious Dorothy Vallens and drags Jeffrey into the unseen underworld of Frank Booth.For the majority of people, you either like Lynch or you dislike him. Personally I like the majority of his work, I love the sense of normalcy that he can create and slowly change to reveal a darkness that is worryingly close to the surface.  That is the case here, beginning with a blue sky, white picket fence vision of small town America the camera drops into the grass to see a torrent of bugs scrambling just under the surface.  In the same way the film follows Jeffrey's journey into the underbelly of his home town.In some ways this is one of the easiest Lynch films to get into  here the darkness is not a wide world of demons as in Fire Walk With Me, but is one man and his associates who can be overcome.  The darkness is therefore accessible to all but is laced with just enough weirdness to disturb  my favourite scene is where Frank takes Jeffrey to see Ben, it is just a little unsettling.  In hand with this is the fact that it is easily one of his most optimistic films, the good angel in Jeffrey's life is a strong character and the ending is one of certainty rather than open to interpretation  that robin has about a clear a meaning as it can.MacLachlan is well used as Jeffrey.  He is wide eyed and innocent even when being sucked into the underworld.  Dern plays `all-American' well but doesn't have the complexity of MacLachlan in the script.  Rossellini has a challenging role and carries it off quite well  I didn't fully understand her character but I don't know if that was my fault or hers.  Of course the film belongs to Hopper who is terrifyingly unstable.  Without a doubt he is a monster and you never are left in any doubt as to his state of mind.  For an example of his work here watch the scene where Stockwell (in a wonderfully weird cameo) sings and Hopper clearly falls to pieces.Although I prefer Fire Walk With Me, I do think that this is Lynch's best film.  It is weird without going totally overboard and it allows us to sink into the underworld gradually without sudden falls.  Hopper controls every scene he is in, but the meeting of wholesome and weird is perfectly delivered and is trademark Lynch.
David Lynch is a very love-him-hate-him director, with people fascinated by his style and imagery and others who find his films not easy to follow and too weird for their tastes. As somebody who loves Lynch and a lot of his films(the only one I've disliked is Dune), Blue Velvet is up there at the top. The Elephant Man(never has there been a film that moved me more) may be my personal favourite but Blue Velvet is quite possibly Lynch's masterpiece. Loved Mulholland Drive as well, but it is not as accessible as Elephant Man or Blue Velvet- films that even those who aren't fans of Lynch are likely to love- and is his most polarising most likely.Blue Velvet is an incredible-looking film. All of Lynch's films are beautifully shot and that is true of Blue Velvet as well, and the imagery is both hauntingly surreal and beautiful, all the different colours really popping out at you. The music is hypnotic with a very haunting undercurrent and really adds to the story's strangeness and mystery elements. The script is thoughtful and cohesive with a dose of weird but subtle humour as well as some deliberately not so subtle parts(especially with villain Frank Booth). The atmosphere created is the very meaning of scintillating and suspense levels are to the maximum. The story- one of the most coherent and accessible of any Lynch film- is always interesting and entertaining, the detective story elements are genuinely suspenseful and at times scary, Lynch has never directed a tenser scene than the climax here.Lynch's direction is superb; along with Mulholland Drive it contains some of his best. The characters all serve a point to the story and they are very interestingly written, in the case of Frank Booth, one of the most evil and fascinating villains on films, iconic. The acting is superb as well, especially with Dennis Hopper who's terrifyingly sadistic and sometimes hilarious, he is very over the top but in a gleefully enjoyable way. Kyle MacLachlan has never been in a better film or given a better performance than here, he's certainly not had a character as interesting either, Laura Dern is great and sensual Isabella Rossellini has a challenging role that she plays to truly devastating effect. Look out for an oddball but memorable appearance from Dean Stockwell as well. Overall, a strange but utterly mesmerising masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox
What surprised me was how very different this was from the two other great David Lynch films I'd seen: "Lost Highway" and "The Straight Story", which are in turn very different from one another. I'd been told by a disappointed David Lynch fan, back in 1997, that the only reason I was so deeply impressed with "Lost Highway" was that I hadn't seen "Bue Velvet", in which he does much the same kind of thing better. "Blue Velvet" may indeed be better (I wouldn't want to say), but in no respect is it the same kind of thing. (The only instance I've encountered so far of Lynch making the same film twice is "Lost Highway" being remade as "Mulholland Drive", which partly accounts for the latter film being so stale and uninvolving.)"Blue Velvet" is a simple amateur sleuthing story, but the genius is in the telling of it. It's hard to avoid the feeling that something supernatural is somehow involved, although it isn't, and we know that it isn't. It looks and feels as though we're watching the world through a special enchanted (or cursed) prism: the image has been pulled apart, ALMOST into two distinct images, with the elements of pure evil and pure wholesomeness now distinct from one another, sitting just millimetres apart.Unrelated to this, but still contributing to the intense suspense and the overall creepiness, is Lynch's ability to make us familiar with a few ordinary locations, which grow more sinister - or at least more meaningful - every time we see them, until the sight of a simple concrete stairwell in the dark is enough to make us start to panic.
I think I get it, and there's some very interesting concepts that could make for a great movie, but the execution ruined most of it for me. It's quite shocking to me this is genuinely considered by many to be one of the best films of all time. Don't get me wrong, there's aspects that deserve praise but most of the movie isn't even that well made in my opinion. The entire movie feels so stilted and clunky, from the performances, dialogue, editing, etc. You know you've failed when you make a literal rape scene unintentionally funny. None of the acting is good, honestly feeling like a student film. It's baffling to me this would get an Oscar nomination for it's directing. Are there good elements to the directing? Yes, it's pretty decently shot, it has some good symbolism, but mostly everything else fails. Some scenes feel like the actors weren't even directed. Sometimes it's hammy, and other times it's under-acted. Also I really dislike the pauses and whispering in some scenes. Can you really call a movie that makes a rape scene unintentionally funny well directed? The characters are all very thin and basic, they could've used so much more development to further strengthen the themes. It's like they only got the most basic elements to make these characters, but forgot to actually delve into them. It feels bare bones, and while the bones are strong It forgot the meat to truly support it. Not that all need much development, but most of the characters feel unrealistic, and unbelievable without much development. The plot is basic, bland, and even contrived at times. There's nothing that special or original about it, so the execution is what would set it apart, and it does by being mostly stilted and silly in all the wrong places. I honestly found most of the movie to be unenjoyable. I also believe it could've been shorter and had a tighter edit to at least be more enjoyable. Though at the same time it could've also been longer to further flesh out certain aspects of the film. The script feels like an early draft for a potentially great movie. Ironically Lynch's direction feels wrong for this type of movie. Yes, there are great elements in this movie, but the execution is middling at best. This movie is like the opposite of the opening scene, with the disgusting cockroaches at the top covering the rich grass brimming with potential that never quite got out. I would argue some of this movie is badly made, but I still gave it a 5.5/10 because I recognize it does have some great stuff deep in it. Maybe I really didn't get it, and Lynch's style isn't for me, but again, to me for the subject matter in this movie to be this badly executed is not a stylistic choice but an obvious flaw with the direction and movie. This is something I'll probably revisit when I watch more Lynch films, I hope I'm wrong about it, but this isn't a good start from his filmography for me.(5.5/10)Note: This is an old review I wrote last year that I always meant to expand especially after watching more Lynch and if I rewatch this film, but for now I thought I might as well post this.
Title: Blue Velvet (1986)Director: David Lynch Cast: Isabella Rosellini, Kyle Mac Lachlan, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern Review: David Lynch films are paintings come to life, this has very much to do with the fact that Lynch himself is a painter and he brings that artistic point of view to his film making. Like a good painting, his movies tell a story, which much like an abstract painting, is not always easy to figure out. But what a treat it is to try.Blue Velvet is a story about a young man returning to his hometown to visit his father who is sick in the hospital. Upon his return he stumbles upon a frightening discovery: a human ear lying on the grass as he walks through the forest behind his parents home. He then takes it upon himself to discover where this ear came from and discovers that that ear will be the reason why he discovers that this is in fact a very strange and dangerous world in which we live in.Lynch is synonymous with the strange and unusual and Blue Velvet is a good example of this. For those who have ventured into Lynchian territory with films like Mullholland Dr. or Lost Highway get ready for some more crazy imagery and messed up situations. But Ill be honest this time around, even though the situations and images are very very surreal and strange the story itself is pretty easy to understand. Lost Highway remains a total mystery to me to this day, Mullholland Dr. I had to watch about 6 times to figure out....but Blue Velvet though equally as strange and fascinating as those films mentioned, is actually easy to follow and understand.I loved Kyle MacLachlans character and it was very interesting to see him go through the changes he goes through after he makes his discoveries. He isn't quite the same anymore after he sees the things he sees and does the things he does. Loved that scene in which Laura Dern tries to let him see that even though there's some crazy things in this world there's some good bound to show up sooner or later. Laura Derns character was beautiful and innocent, the one thing that could bring balance to MacLachlans character. By far the most interesting and memorable thing in this film is Dennis Hoppers character, yes my friends, I'm talking about that crazy, demented, sex-crazed freak known as Frank Booth.Frank Booth is one of those characters that just oozes with evil. You don't feel like its this actor playing some villain, when that happens you totally stop believing that said villain is dangerous. Not so here. Hopper looks, breaths and speaks pure evil! Your kind of scared that there might actually be people like him out in the real world. His scenes and dialog is truly disturbing stuff....."Ill f##C@ anything that moooves!" I loved the visual aspect of the film which was -as is usual in a Lynch film- extremely beautiful. We may be looking at sliced human ears and demented sex freaks...but everything is photographed within the context of beautiful haunting colors, exotic plays of shadows and lights. Great visuals. The music is incredible as well. Lynch seems to be fond of lounge singers cause very much like he did in Mullholland Drive in Club Silencio, we get another sequence much like that one, with Isabella Rosellini singing us "Blue Velvet" the title song. And there's also a sequence which is very very humorous yet strange and alluring....Dean Stockwell singing Roy Orbinsons "In Dreams". Awesome sequence, one of the most memorable sequences on this film or any other Lynch film. When that scene comes on, you'll be transported to another time and place. What time and place it is Ill leave it up to you.All in all a great Lynch film not to be missed. A masterpiece that lets me know why Lynch is one of the greatest American directors ever to be in the business of making bizarro, beautiful cinema.Rating: 5 out of 5 (and very very much so!)
One has to watch a David Lynch movie just to say you have seen one. This was actually nominated for an Academy Award and won many others, so it is probably as good as any to see. I tried Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, but couldn't get more than a couple of scenes before I gave up. I was able to hang in there for this.There has to be something there, but I just don't get it. The man has four Academy Award nominations for his films. He must be doing something that I just don't see.Closeups of bugs in the grass or the inside of an ear is not stirring cinematography to me.An example of the dialog you have to endure in this film:Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan): You're a neat girl. Sandy Williams (Laura Dern): So are you... I mean, you're a neat guy.This wasn't random, but typical. And, what's with the "chicken walk"?Maybe some think it is worth enduring to see Isabella Rossellini nude walking like a zombie.I was worth enduring just to know what a David Lynch film is like, and to avoid them in the future.
Back in the days when David Lynch's movies used to be coherent, this film proves to be one of the most powerful in a long line of odd and strange films. I felt all of the actors were exceptional in this film, reflecting the power and evil in Dennis Hopper's character. I can't see anyone else in this role, and Hopper proved once again he is the go-to guy when it comes to portraying a lunatic. Lynch's cinematography and artistic endeavors fit in so perfectly with each other, the film reeks of noir and suspense. An excellent film to watch for any first time Lynch watchers.
To watch Blue Velvet for the first time 31 years after its original release is a treat of unexpected proportions. I'm not going to tell about the story because, I'm sure, each one of us could tell it in very different ways. The blandness of Kyle MacLachland here is a major plus. It's not him that rivet us but his circumstances. And the circumstances are truly riveting, terrifying, unpredictable and gloriously cinematic. Dennis Hopper is superb, disgustingly so and Isabella Rossellini creates a character that was totally new to me. Related to many others but new, disturbingly so. Dean Stockwell has a moment that I know already will stay in my mind for ever. I'm so glad I finally saw it.
When college student Jeffrey Beaumont's father is hospitalised he returns home to what at first appears to be the Perfect American Town... he soon discovers that it is anything but. On a piece of wasteland he finds a severed human ear which he takes to Detective John Williams, a friend of his fathers. Williams' daughter Sandy approaches Jeffrey and tells him she overheard her father talking about a possible connection to singer Dorothy Vallens; Jeffrey decides to investigate. This leads to him getting caught in a very dangerous place with some incredibly disturbing characters; most notably Frank Booth.This is very much a David Lynch film; the situation has a not-quite-real feel without being quite as weird as 'Twin Peaks'... it is far more disturbing though. Kyle MacLachlan is impressive as the ordinary Jeffrey caught in an extraordinary situation but it is Dennis Hopper who steals every scene he is in as the Frank... one of cinema's more disturbing creations. The way the story unfolds creates a real sense of danger and its ending is far from clear till almost the end. The rest of the cast are solid; most notably Isabella Rossellini as femme fatale Dorothy and Laura Dern as the innocent Sandy. Due to the disturbing nature of many scenes, which include sexual violence, this certainly won't be for everybody but if you like disturbing neo-noir then this is definitely a must see.
There is far more to 'Blue Velvet' than meets the eye.  You can't label this as drama, satire, or black comedy.  It just doesn't work.'Blue Velvet' is an example of our world's disarray.  This film is VERY genius in its portrayal.  We see a hokey, innocent town that yields a dark secret.The symbolism is great.  White picket fences, waving fireman, hokey acting, and a sunny day show the apparent innocence.  But a stroke, black insects, a candle getting blown out, etc. show us something else.I love how when we see the innocence, everything is hokey.  The music, acting, dialogue... everything.  But when the darkness appears, everything becomes serious.  The script improves, the acting is better... everything. That's something that was missed by most viewers.David Lynch is brilliant, but he also has a great sense of humor.  Jokes aren't funny... absurdity is funny.Lightness and darkness seemingly coexist in this lumber town... each in their own place.  When a curious fellow returns home, he disrupts the balance and the two forces go to war.  Yet, we don't really even know which side he's on.  I love how Jeffrey always wears black and white.  I love all the symbology of this film.If you haven't seen this yet, break away from the Hollywood cookie cutter movies and prepare to have your mind challenged and entertained.Makes a fun party movie, too.   ;o)10/10
The sexual revolution in film came some ten years after the label's coinage in the late Sixties. It probably began with Last Tango in Paris. Directed by the acclaimed Bernardo Bertolucci, Last Tango is notorious for a sex scene involving Marlon and roughly a third of a stick of butter. Theretofore sex in film could potentially be used as a means of revealing the lightest or the darkest character's traits: primarily, vulnerability, instinct, sadism and impulse. Blue Velvet is a good example of a movie using such a dynamic. Blue Velvet is not a film that is easily appreciated. Likewise, it is not a film that is easily forgotten. It is a timeless controversy, and it is a vision demanding attention if not praise. Set in a small American town, Blue Velvet is a dark, sensuous mystery involving the intertwining lives of four very different individuals. The film's painful realism reminds us that we are not immune to the disturbing events which transpire in Blue Velvet's sleepy community. There is a darker side of life waiting for us all. And as a critic said 'you either think it's dementedly wild at heart or a lost highway to nowhere'. Even some eighteen years after the release of Blue Velvet its vision remains wildly adamant relative to the stride of other works of contemporary noir. There have been many films about suburban crime, but none as dangerously imposing as this. Why is that so? If Blue Velvet might not be labeled as a masterpiece one has to acknowledge that there are in this movie a lot of so called 'masterpiece element' and if Blue Velvet will never be considered as Mr. Lynch best feature, I personally can see a lot of David Lynch's genius flowing in that movie.First of all, the way David Lynch makes Blue Velvet increasingly disturbing is a perfect example of how pristine the dynamics of weirdness and tension are built (remember Eraserhead and Elephant Man). Through this process Mr. Lynch indeed deconstructs the audience expectations. The film setting and mood are introduced in an exposition lifted directly from older films (there are numerous references to It's A Wonderful Life). In result the film is initially expected to follow a particular path. The way Mr. Lynch associate elements of classic narrative methodology and 'his dynamics of noir' (previously explained) appears to be original at worst 'avant gardiste' at best. Second of all, the opposition between the creepiness of the plot and the setting of it is definitely for me a masterpiece element. The film is set in Lumberton. This does not represent a quaint, small town by similarity; it is one. Lumberton is filled with characters that are completely typical. I can almost see the cops eating doughnuts in the coffee shop and the local football star dating the head cheerleader. This typicality is definitely not out of coincidence but of intention. In fact these characters function to punctuate the story, not to distinguish it. The 'infamous' individuality of Lynch's vision is established in the darker side of Lumberton. Our perspective throughout the film is fixed on Jeffery, and is deliberately biased by his good nature. Jeffery is portrayed with great subtlety by Kyle MacLachlan (FBI agent from "Twin Peaks"). He is paired with Sandy (Laura Dern), the daughter of a neighborhood investigator who epitomizes to perfection the 'girl-next-door'; in Blue Velvet it is her literal function. Completing this diverse list of roles is a haunting and brief performance by Dean Stockwell as well as Dennis Hopper who creates a flabbergasting portrait of unrepentant and irredeemable evil. The confrontation or those characters or the collision among themselves makes for a mesmerizing experience. Once again Mr. Lynch succeeds in the masterful exercise of controlling the audience's attention. Most of us will not quite know what to make of it and we can disagree on the value of such a cinematic experience. However audacious, erotic, disturbing, haunting are adjectives that will always be linked with Blue Velvet. The 'Thriller' has just been re-invented by Mr. Lynch right in front of our eyes.
I think that this is the movie that took me through five layers of enlightenment.If you've known me for more than 0.2 seconds, you'll probably know that David Lynch is my favourite director ever. His works never cease to astound me, and of all of his already-perfect films, I would have to say that Blue Velvet really is not only the best film that he's made, but the best film of the 20th century, if not of all time.There's something so stylistically beautiful and genre-defying about Blue Velvet. Something so sleek and so enchanting, combined with Lynch's classic horror, captivates you just like the eponymous song.What's interesting about Blue Velvet is that even though it's one of Lynch's most confusing works, and the storyline isn't as strange as one of his later films (say, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive), it still manages to be so incredibly disturbing and mind-bendingly horrific, to the point that sometimes you feel obliged to have to watch through your fingers.Blue Velvet peels back the layers of the American dream to reveal a dark underworld that will haunt your mind for days. That signature opening with the unnaturally blood-red roses against a white picket fence and an artificially bright sky sets the theme of the slightly too-perfect image of suburbia that continues through the film, and contrasts jarringly with the things we later see and find. And that gorgeous song. Blue Velvet echoes throughout the film, and whenever you hear it you cannot help but be entranced.There was not a single bad performance in this movie. Isabella Rossellini as the beautiful and troubled Dorothy Vallens, Laura Dern as "the girl next door", Dennis Hopper as the psychotic Frank Booth, and, of course, Kyle MacLachlan as our innocent young protagonist. How did none of these incredibly talented people get any sort of Oscar recognition? How did this movie generally not get any sort of Oscar recognition besides just a nomination for Best Director? Come on! Best Picture nom, at least!This movie is certainly not for everyone, what with how horrifically graphic and disturbing it gets, every now and then, but let me tell you: when all is said and done, it really is a cinematic masterpiece and is my favourite movie of all time, and I don't see that changing any time soon.-Sasha.
Oh boy, what a weird movie. How can I even comment it.David Lynch films are not easy to get into (at least for me). Usually I don't like them upon first viewing, but at least Mulholland Drive has slowly become my super favorite. I don't expect Blue Velvet to climb as high, but there is some grower potential.I liked the beginning the best, when it's like a murder mystery. But then it goes crazy in all directions and I don't really know what to think. But some things are certain: the cinematography is beautiful and atmosperic, and there is a lot of great acting. Dennis Hopper is totally crazy in this film, but others aren't bad either.If you like strange movies, see this one. But only if you can stomach some violence and sexual weirdness as well. I will probably get an urge to want to see it again at some point because it has such a distinct atmosphere and style.
After hearing all the hype of how this is an artistic, intellectual & enigmatic film, I figured I would love it to death. Instead, I found myself *wishing* for death.Roger Ebert got it right when he called it "a story that's marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots. The director is either denying the strength of his material or trying to defuse it by pretending it's all part of a campy in-joke."It begins impressively with excellent cinematic technique and symbolism, but as soon as the first words are spoken, the film begins to sag with ridiculous, predictable and juvenile dialogue. The plot itself is tediously linear and simple, like an average Hardy Boys episode: high school kids take on the criminal underworld!But, oh, this is no Hardy Boys episode. Director David Lynch made sure of that, by injecting plenty of profanity, gore, and nudity. (And just as an aside to all you drooling fans of Isabella Rosselini... TRUST me, she & her beer-belly look awful in this movie! Save yourselves the shattered fantasies.)The scenes are extremely clumsy and overt, as if Lynch doesn't give us enough credit for figuring it out ourselves. I'll give you one example: In one scene, Laura Dern and Dune Boy (forgot his name) are sitting in a car in front of a church. Laura starts talking about her dream of God. The music switches to a church pipe organ. Then they drive off, and the camera zooms in on the church and holds the frame for 3 full seconds. (...hmmm, d'ya git the feelin he's a-trying to tell us sumthin? I dunno, Vern. Lez rewind it and watch it again.)True, compared to the Hollywood tripe that was the standard in 1986, _Blue Velvet_ is unique. But that doesn't mean it's good. I would advise you to watch Lynch's 1990 film _Wild at Heart_ in which he achieved a greater degree poetry, having refined his style somewhat. Well, you have been warned!
With Blue Velvet, David Lynch made a film that was so pure to his original vision that it would become the archetype of his work for the next fifteen years.  Here, Lynch cast his ever probing, surrealist gaze upon small town middle America, and for the first time in a US film, showed the audience the darker side to what was often depicted as nothing more than the birth place of apple pie. We are drawn into the story almost immediately, with what would seem like a simple depiction of small town life, but the use of slow-motion hints that there is something not quite right with what we are looking at.  So by the time Lynch has pushed his camera through the soft green grass of a regular front lawn, only to show us the slithering insects that hide in the darkness, we know that we are about to enter a very dark world.Blue Velvet is a world filled with not only darkness, but also ambiguity. The characters of this world are constantly hiding behind some kind of façade, be it the wardrobe doors that practicing teenage voyeur Jeffrey peers from behind as he watches Dorothy and Frank interact, or something as simple as the make-up worn by Ben.  Everything suggests to us that these characters inhabit a world at night, a world away from the life they live in the day.  As the film moves closer and closer to the climax Jeffrey begins to feel more of a connection with Frank, having to go to some very dark places within his psyche.  However Lynch's message, that underneath the normal persona of a regular human being is a repressed pervert laying in wait, or whatever point he is making doesn't really translate well.  Not least to today's audience.  Blue Velvet is very much a film of its time, that time being the mid-eighties, with aids paranoia everywhere, it's easy to see this metaphor for the dangers of sex and love within the films turgid dreamscapes.  But beneath this message hides a strong detective story, a modern day neo-noir that delivers interesting twists and a controversial pay-off with it's almost fairytale climax.  This is the film David Lynch got right, proceeding to make great films that where all personal, but completely different in terms of style and substance from one another.  Blue Velvet is a great film, with some fine (albeit bizarre) performances, still challenging to this day, If only Lynch hadn't gone on to spend the rest of his career re-making it.
In some ways, this reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's reaction to directing Spartacus, a movie he had no creative control on and found deadening, by directing Lolita as his follow up. For Lynch, Dune was a draining experience of constant compromise that led to the end result of a less than stellar film, so he followed it up with an intensely personal film at a much smaller scale where he had full control in Blue Velvet.Blue Velvet tells the story of Kyle MacLachlan's Jeffrey who investigates a weird crime and potential murder in a small town with a logging industrial footprint, finding that the thin veneer of Americana hides a seedy underbelly of corruption, sex, and murder. Sound familiar? Yeah, it's a prototype of Twin Peaks.Anyway, Jeffrey Beaumont has come home from college to the small town of Lumbertron, North Carolina after his father had a heart attack. Walking back from the hospital one day, he discovers a human ear in a field. Taking it to his neighbor, a police detective, and learning some key pieces of information from the detective's daughter, Sandy, Jeffrey enters into a dangerous world that he might not survive. His entry point is a lounge singer, Dorothy Vallens, who was under surveillance by the police on an unrelated matter that got brought up to Detective Williams. Jeffrey sneaks in, hides in her closet, and watches a horrid display of sadism and masochism when Frank Booth shows up to extract what he wants from Dorothy.These two characters, Dorothy and Frank, represent an extreme of choice open to Jeffrey, the young man still figuring out who he wants to be. On the other end are his father in the hospital and Sandy. Sandy is the good girl, the daughter of a good policeman, who wants to love and be loved. Dorothy and Frank represent a more dangerous, exciting, and degrading life of abuse, and what Jeffrey discovers is that for all he was brought up to believe in one code of behavior, he has it within himself to fall into Frank's lifestyle. That comes to the fore for him when he makes love to Dorothy and he hits her at her insistence.That leads me to this very obvious observation: Blue Velvet looks at a very ugly side of life, and it looks at it unflinchingly. However, what makes it most interesting is Lynch's ability to balance vastly different tones within the same scene. This was obvious in Eraserhead, but he had never really managed to deal in the same kind of tonal shifts with The Elephant Man and Dune, at least at the same level. Blue Velvet represents an extreme example of this, and quite possibly my single favorite scene in all of David Lynch's filmography does it in this film.Jeffrey has gotten in too deep, and Frank has discovered him. Frank has every intention of intimidating and threatening Jeffrey, maybe even killing him. Frank Booth, you see, is a marvelous cinematic creation from both David Lynch and Dennis Hopper. He's a deranged freak killer who inhales amyl nitrite to enhance his sexual experiences (changed from helium in the script, which would have been hilarious but perhaps distractingly so) and has turned Dorothy into his sex slave by kidnapping her husband and child. Her husband is the proper owner of that ear that Jeffrey found. He is the only one to curse (aside from one single instance where Frank forces another to say it), and his dialogue is laced with profanity. He sticks out from everything around him all the time. He's like a force of nature, an elemental creation that has the motivation of a hurricane approaching a coastline. He is a purely destructive force manifested in a man, and his success as an onscreen villain has everything to do with Dennis Hopper. Fresh off of going sober after years of alcohol and drug abuse, Hopper knew he was on extremely thin ice and that this part was a goldmine. He gave the part his all, imbuing Frank with such interesting malevolence that he's always fascinating to simply watch.Frank's malevolent best and the movie's deft balance of wildly different tones come together in one particular scene best. Frank takes Jeffery and Dorothy to Ben's whorehouse where he is keeping Dorothy's husband and child. The scene as Dorothy cries in the other room at the sight of her son while Frank demands cold Pabst Blue Ribbon from one of the women and Ben mouths the words to Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" is such an expert combination of menace, terror, and hilarity at the same time.The movie's one flaw, I think, is Dorothy. Isabella Rosellini threw herself into this role, baring herself literally and figuratively in portraying a woman in and of an abusive relationship, but I think she's a bit underwritten. I would imagine that she's given more time to breathe and exist in the two hours of deleted scenes, an hour of which Criterion managed to release on the Blu-ray, but she has the makings of such a complex character who could center an entire film on her own instead of being a supporting character in Jeffrey's story of becoming his own man. There's more to her, and I think a lot of it ended up on the cutting room floor.Jeffrey, however, is the main character and everything that happens in this movie is about him discovering the truth of the world around him and about himself. He could be a good, quiet man like his father, watering his lawn by hand, or he could be like Frank, abusing Dorothy at her own insistence. The resolution is all about him making that choice, and it's not about being a pure version of either. He has to do something awful in order to choose the right path.Blue Velvet is also one of the best combinations of image and narrative Lynch has. Thinking of the final major sequence, where Jeffery shows up at Dorothy's apartment to find the man in yellow standing with an exposed head wound, Dorothy's husband tied up in a chair, and the television playing, Lynch's creates this surrealistic moment that feels extreme and of the reality of the movie at the same time. There's also the look of Dorothy singing on stage, draped in a blue dress with a red curtain behind her that pops in the frame. The movie is really visually fascinating and eye catching all the way through.Aside from the underwritten nature of Dorothy, this is Lynch reclaiming who he is as a filmmaker in grand fashion. He's telling a distinctly American story born from his own experiences growing up, informed by his own distinct method of storytelling that borders on dream logic.
...and it isn't because I don't get or appreciate surrealism or because I missed the element of satire. I 'got it' alright. I just don't want it.The story begins when naive college boy finds a human ear in a grown-over abandoned lot near his father's home, puts it in a bag, and takes it to the police station, where his discovery is greeted with a diffident, "Yup, that's a human ear alright." A conversation with the town sheriff's teenage daughter reveals that it might have something to do with a mysterious and glamorous lounge singer. So Jeffrey does what anyone would do- break into her apartment and spy on her, of course. And finding him hiding in her closet, listening to her phone conversations and watch her undress, the lounge singer, Dorothy, does what any woman would do under the circumstances- give him oral sex, of course! It practically goes without saying! The two of them embark on a lopsided affair that never fully blossoms, while Jeffrey woos sweet teenage Sandy on the side. Meanwhile, wrapped up in unstable Dorothy's sexual psychodrama, Jeffrey plays some cross between detective and knight and shining armor to a damsel in distress, and revels in Dorothy's co-dependent clinging, all the while knowing that this affair could get him killed.Dorothy's lover/stalker/tormentor is a ragingly nuts, repulsively perverted mafia a-hole named Frank, in the most disgustingly creepy role in Dennis Hopper's proud legacy of playing scary, nutbag freaks. Frank's infantile-yet-violent, jack rabbit dry-humping perversion, not to mention his obliviousness to how obnoxious and repugnant it is, is enough to make you never want to have sex again. Yet, Frank and Dorothy are both quite obviously insane- what's Jeffrey's excuse for his bizarre, irrational choices? The fact that he is apparently sane and fairly intelligent makes it all the more annoying. Every single character in the film is so annoying to me that I want to smack 'em upside the head, but the two women in the story are just plain pitiful.Sandy and Dorothy are sort of a Betty and Veronica/rose white-rose red case. Dorothy is an older, glamorous, beautiful brunette, while Sandy is a younger, pretty, virginal blonde. Sandy is the least stupid and irritating character in the beginning, but I lost patience with her after she immediately forgave Jeffrey for his affair with Dorothy with very little explanation or effort from Jeffrey, then continually pins the blame on herself for "dragging him into this" when the situation is quite the opposite. Sandy puts herself in harm's way for Jeffrey even though he has lied to her, and at the close of the film is in the kitchen happily making him lunch while he lounges around in the back yard. For his part, Jeffrey just seems like a melodramatic sap who's "in love" with whoever's there at the moment. You really can't tell if his feelings for either Dorothy or Sandy have any depth to them.What really works my nerves, though, is the woefully corny dialog, with absurdly over-earnest lines like, "Why is there so much trouble in the world?!?!" and "You're my special friend!" Not to mention, "I looked for you in the closet last night." Granted, all these lines are kinda funny, but are they supposed to be? And who's the joke on, the characters or the viewer. Either way, if it weren't for my roommate being there to mock it with me, I would have turned this movie off about 15 minutes into it.How movies like this gain backing, let alone a cult following, I'll never know. But when it comes to satirizing suburbia, though, give me John Waters any day.
Blue Velvet is extremely upsetting and disturbing, and yet I can't take my eyes away from it. I always feel dirty watching this movie. Like it's something I shouldn't be watching. Like I need a shower after.The performances are all great, but for me the standouts are Laura Dern and Dennis Hopper.Hopper in particular is amazing as Frank. If the"f word" was a person, that would be Frank. Just an absoulety despicable human being in every way. He's as repulsive as he is fascinating.That's the film in a nutshell. Repulsive, yet fascinating. I hate watching it but I love that feeling.
I've always contended that David's Lynch writes most of his scripts after he has awakened from bad dreams. This is the story of a nice young guy who has pretty much all he could want. One day, he makes the mistake of his life, getting involved with an older woman (Isabella Rosellini) and all the fallout from that almost destroys him. Soon he is in the hands of some of the most eccentric and dangerous people we could ever meet. Mainly, Dennis Hopper, a psychotic, who has a claim on the woman. Soon the boy's life is not his own and he can't seem to escape. The world he is in is the total opposite of the one he had but a few weeks before. So much has already been written about this film. I will only say that Hopper is one of the most threatening presences I have ever witnessed. As I watched this film the first time, I had all I could do to stay in the theater. There's an overriding sickness here where we want to grab this kid and move him to another continent to get him away; but we feel we still have to watch.
It has its good points. When Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) sings the title song in the club, the film exudes wonderful atmosphere. Other oldies-but-goodies songs also are enjoyable to listen to. And the film's color cinematography, with its vibrant hues, is quite effective. Otherwise, this film is just awful.Set in small town America in the early 1960s, the film opens with a young man named Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) who finds a human ear, while strolling through the woods one day. Jeffrey's curiosity propels the plot through a convoluted story involving strange characters, sex, drugs, and murder. It's all rather seedy. And the film's excessive violence is annoying.The story's inciting incident is not remotely plausible. The plot makes no sense. Some of the dialogue is sophomoric. And the characters are dreadful. The Frank Booth character (Dennis Hopper) is so outlandish as to be cartoonish. His use of an oxygen mask is nothing but a gimmick. Hopper makes matters worse by overplaying the role. The Ben character (Dean Stockwell) is bizarre, and not in a good way. And Dorothy is an emotional wreck, whiny and easily manipulated.The film's casting and acting are wretched. Kyle MacLachlan is as bad in this film as he was in "Dune" (1984). He's bland, lacks suitable expressiveness, and is annoyingly nerdy. If he were any stiffer, he could pass for a mannequin. I don't know who was worse: dull MacLachlan or farcical Dennis Hopper. Rossellini tries to act, but her performance comes across as comically melodramatic which, when combined with Hopper's histrionics, renders scenes that are unintentionally funny.The film's moody atmosphere makes for suitable cinematic style. But the script, the direction, the casting, and the acting are so bad that the end result is a cartoon for spaced-out adults. And the emphasis on gratuitous violence suggests that Director David Lynch was making an effort to distract viewers from the film's hokey contrivances. I'd say he succeeded rather well.
Young man visits his family in cozy hometown, but after finding a severed ear in a nearby field he follows a trail of corruption, sadism and murder. David Lynch-directed torment, full of bright and beguiling colors, features many of his now-familiar themes (the city vs. the suburbs, the evil which lurks under our everyday existence), but it was a lot more provocative in 1986 than today. And, since time has not been kind to the presentation, attentions are more focused on the performances, which are variable. Dennis Hopper, as the resident psychopath, really goes out a limb and performs his role with gusto; it's an overscaled, though admittedly singular achievement, yet also a horribly unpleasant one, and you can't shake Hopper away once he's off-screen (and when he returns, so do the bad vibes). The film's surreal, daydreamy mood is well-captured, as is the nightmare-in-the-daytime ambiance, but the picture's atmosphere has to go a long way towards making "Blue Velvet" worth watching again. It just hasn't held up. ** from ****
Dark. Twisted. Fragile. Dangerous. Delinquent characters mingle in downtown hotels and outbuildings - a stones throw away from suburbia. Is this a horror film?
Outrageous! This is another sick-but-fascinating David Lynch film, maybe his sickest, although I've never seen Eraserhead. The most interesting feature of this strange movie, I think, was the weird characters, one after the other. Make that ultra-weird.....and the strangest of them all is "Bobby Peru," played by Willem Dafoe. In all my years of movie watching, I think "Bobby Peru" still has to rank in the top five of the creepiest characters. He is so outrageously disgusting and perverted you just have to laugh out loud at him.In fact, "outrageous" might be the best word to describe this film, characters and all.This wild and entertaining film sometimes makes me shake my head in disgust that I own it, and at other times makes me just laugh out loud at the absurdity of it. You really have to have a dark sense of humor to appreciate much of it. I do, to some degree....enough to keep viewing this.Nicholas Cage is particularly fun to watch and provides most of the laughs. Laura Dern is also convincing as a trailer-trash-type. If you want a clue on why Dern would play such a sleazy role, check out her real-life mom in this film, Diane Ladd, who plays her mother in the movie. It looks like Mom passed on her wholesome values.As with some other Lynch films, the music is outstanding: just a great soundtrack. I bought the CD to this a year after first seeing the movie, and I've always enjoyed it. And, another Lynch trait that certainly is here is the excellent visual style, which is enhanced by the widescreen DVD.So, if you are looking for an outrageous two hours and you aren't easily shocked or offended, this would be a film to consider.
Wild at Heart begins with an arresting scene of bloody violence by one of the two lead characters, Sailor Ripley, and this immediately grabs our attention. After this he hooks up with his lover, Lula, who he fiercely protects, and goes on a bizarre road trip into the deep south of the states, while avoiding Lula's mother, played with passion by a deservedly Oscar-nominated Diane Ladd, who has an obsessive hatred for Sailor. They meet an assortment of weird people, especially Bobby Peru, and also Perdita Durango, who has appeared recently in a film with her name as the title, also written by Barry Gifford. It is classic David Lynch, with a homage type theme to the Wizard of Oz. It has the sensuality and eroticism later seen in Lost Highway, the violence and gore, the head sequence after the bank robbery being graphic, and a general uneasiness throughout. But it is a darkly humorous and transfixing piece.
The most creative and controversial director in cinema is back with a road-movie! Wild at Heart is one rough roller coaster ride and a typical Lynch-cocktail of violence, sex and of coursebizarre characters. I challenge you to find one personality in this film that could be referred to as a normal human being'. As usually, Lynch introduces a bunch of wicked individuals in his film who're all messed up in the head pretty bad. Yet, I feel like Wild at Heart might be Lynch's most accessible film (outside The Elephant Man and The Straight Story). The structure remains chronological and quite easy to follow. Unlike the previous Blue Velvet, I feel like the plot and development of Wild at Heart is a bit inferior to the wonderful photography. The greatest aspects in the screenplay are in fact the delicious side-chapters that are told without absolute necessity. Like the story about Lula's cousin Dell (Crispin Glover), the torture of Harry Dean Stanton's character and the nasty and disturbing images of a car accident the protagonists come across. These are the little sequences that truly prove Lynch's talent as a storyteller. Overall and simply put: this movie is COOL! It's a joy to watch and you really hate to love some of the offensive characters. Willem Dafoe takes the cake as Bobby Peru. His portrayal is a neat follow-up to Blue Velvet's Frank Booth. Peru is a filthy and despicable pervert with itchy-trigger-fingers! It's a damn shame he hasn't got any more screen time. Wild at Heart surely isn't the greatest masterpiece out there, but you should love it for what it is: an absurd and entertaining adventure with a couple of thought-provoking values and an extraordinary love-lesson.
I feel like "Wild at Heart" is one of Lynch's forgotten films, and I can sort of see why. Though I enjoyed my time with Sailor (Nicolas Cage, "Leaving Las Vegas"), Lula (Laura Dern, "Marriage Story"), and all the other various other bizarre characters that populate this weird romantic tale, I can honestly say that this is one of my least favorite Lynch movies. It's not bad, it just doesn't do a whole lot for me, especially when compared to Lynch's masterpieces (Twin Peaks TV show, "Eraserhead", "Mulholland Drive", "Inland Empire"). When Lynch is at the peak of his directing powers, his films can prompt me to question and meditate upon the very nature of our reality; "Wild at Heart" is just a decent road trip movie with a few really quirky moments and a whole lot of wackos.As a side note: it blows my mind that this won the Palme d'Or in 1990. According to IMDb's trivia section on this film, Roger Ebert, who seemed to have a distaste for Lynch (check out his "Blue Velvet" review), booed so loudly that it almost drowned out the cheers when the award was announced. Though I honestly don't think this film deserves to stand beside the likes of other winners like "Parasite", "Shoplifters", "Blue is the Warmest Color", or "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days", I also can't ever imagine being so upset over a film award that I'd boo the recipient... but hey, that's just me.
This is one of my favorite David Lynch films. It is also one of the more transparent, easy to understand Lynch films, although that's not the reason why it's one of my favorites. But that fact also makes Wild at Heart a good candidate for introducing someone to Lynch.On the other hand, although it's more transparent and linear on a surface level, I'm still not sure I've figured out the multilayered, bizarre subtexts and symbolism that lie deep beneath the surface--even though I've seen it a few times now. Assuming that there is indeed something to figure out. To an extent, it seems like maybe the hint of something "deeper" is in this case more of a red herring. This is one of Lynch's funnier films, albeit very macabre humor. It contains references to all of Lynch's most common "content quirks"including sequined ingénues singing jazz, manipulative housewife types, shots of asphalt speeding by, minor characters with freaky speech "impediments", severed body parts, and on and on--but it's almost as if he's making fun of himself. Combine that with excellent performances (including a hilarious bit part for Crispin Glover, one of my favorite actors/personalities), a sublimely incongruous score, and a retro, gripping, violent road trip saga cum romance that presages both Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994) and just about all of Quentin Tarantino's career, and you've got quite a film.Wild at Heart, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, is the tale of Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and Lula (Laura Dern), a doe-eyed, "classy white trash" couple. As the film starts--and what a start it is--someone tries to stab Sailor to death as he's exiting a theater. Sailor will have none of it, and Lynch begins the film on an exhilarating, brutally violent note--this is not a film for the faint of heart. To complicate matters and set up the primary conflict, we learn even before the attempted stabbing that the hit man was sent by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd), who claimed that Sailor tried to seduce her in the bathroom (this isn't quite true, as we learn in detail later).There isn't a character in the film who isn't involved with some shady business, either presently or in the past. Sailor and Marietta's tensions stem from many years ago, when Lula was just a girl (she's supposedly quite a bit younger than Sailor). The events of the film's opening result in Sailor being imprisoned. Lula dutifully waits for his release, much to the consternation of her mom. The basic gist of the film is disarmingly simple--Sailor and Lula are headed across the country, with an eventual goal of California, as Marietta tries to arrange for Sailor to be put away for good. There are many finely realized subplots and detailed tangents, but that's the crux of the plot on the surface.In addition to his typical hyperreal/surreal weirdness, Lynch concocts a very improbable stew of influences that work together beautifully. Lula has something of an obsession with The Wizard of Oz (1939). She's haunted by visions of the wicked witch (including the "evil cackle"), and she sees the road trip as a veritable journey to the Emerald City. Lynch works in a lot of subtle references to The Wizard of Oz with other characters, too. Sailor is something like lounge version of Elvis reincarnated as a gangster flunky, with even better karate moves to match. Yet the two are huge heavy metal fans, especially of a band named "Powermad", whose music exquisitely punctuates many sequences, including some sublime dance scenes. In the first half, important scenes are set in New Orleans, with the familiar unsettling undertone that that locale often has in films--you can just smell the voodoo, sex, drugs and death bubbling beneath the skin of the city. Later scenes are set in the desolate, desert prairie country of Texas, which turns out to be even more unsettling (even though I really find such places refreshing and relaxing). There are other kinds of symbolic, stylistic and literal references worked into the film, such as the constant fire motif, which Lynch shoots beautifully, but the above is to just give you an idea of the stew.It all seems like it should add up to some subtextual grand narrative, and maybe it does, but I haven't quite figured out what it all means yet. But it doesn't matter. The stylistic flourishes are ingenious superficially, too, and maybe Lynch _is_ just poking fun at being Lynch. Here, perhaps more than in any other work, he has found the perfect balance between the soap-operatic and the utterly bizarre--the filmic equivalent to author Harry Crews' best work.Tarantino doesn't tend to have pithy subtexts in his films, either, but they're no worse the wear for that, and when Wild at Heart takes a turn into typical Tarantino territory, Lynch is just as captivating, gritty and groovy, plus he's doing it before Tarantino himself. At the same time, Lynch manages to maintain a parallel lush, erotic romance between Sailor and Lula--Dern is incredibly sexy/sensuous here. This material works as well, and supplies what just may be the message of the film after all--that love can (eventually) conquer all, even the stuff that's "wild at heart and weird on top".
Wild at Heart is not David Lynch at his best, personally much prefer Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story and is definitely not going to be everybody's cup of tea. But while it has its flaws Wild at Heart still impresses and fascinates in many ways, also don't think that it's his worst like some people I know in the past have said(that'd be Dune). The story does feel very randomly structured at times, especially true with Crispin Glover, and some of the pacing slackens; the film could have done with being shorter as some scenes did feel too padded and underdeveloped, and the script can be a confused jumble and not always easy to understand completely(though admittedly there are some quotable lines). There are many great things with Wild at Heart however because the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is bursting with vivid colour and there are plenty of bold colours and lighting with some of the visuals being wonderfully deranged. There is also a hypnotic soundtrack that adds so much to the feel of the film, the music choices being also quite interesting, while Lynch's direction while not the best he's ever done(tied between Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive) but it is very adept and has his unique style all over. The story is not the best but the atmosphere is just great, just loved the campiness, the eroticism and haunting weirdness, it's hardly uneventful and there are some memorable moments like the incredibly chilling robbery sequence and the ending. The Wizard of Oz references while a little over-used are fun. The characters are not likable at all, in fact in the cases of Marietta and Bobby a few of them could be seen as loathsome, but considering the atmosphere and viciously violent but also sexy content of the film it is clear that they weren't intended to be. The performances are fine, Nicholas Cage will induce polarising opinions but while he was wooden to start with he was charming and entertaining once he warmed up. Laura Dern is alluring with the two working comfortably together, while Diana Ladd manages to be both hilarious and scary and Willem Dafoe is unforgettably creepy. The cameos acquit themselves well too. All in all, incredibly strange and not without flaws but also fascinating. 7/10 Bethany Cox
Recipient of the prestigious Palme d'Or award at Cannes, David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" is an amazingly brilliant spectacle for the senses. Bold splashes of deep red, curiously staged musical numbers (Nicolas Cage does his own singing  and he's great!), and the continuous references to "The Wizard of Oz" help create a surreal and dreamlike texture to the narrative. The story in brief: Sailor and Lula (excellent performances from both Nicolas Cage & Laura Dern); two broken souls passionately in love, flee the vengeful wrath of Lula's mother Marietta, who for reasons of her own will stop at nothing to ensure the lovers are kept apart. Diane Ladd practically steals the show in her brave portrayal of Lula's psychopathic mother Marietta. Gut wrenchingly violent in places, hopelessly romantic in others; Lynch has crafted an adult fairy tale worthy of multiple viewings. Recommended to those who enjoy and appreciate abstract methods of film-making  a definite 10/10!
When Lynch wants to say something he takes his time, no doubt about it. Sometimes he takes his time even when he doesn't have much to say. Example?Isabella Rosselini in torn stocking, shabby wig, and red shoes is swaying gently to some music when Willem DaFoe crashes in and gives her a vigorous smooch. That's the beginning and the end of the scene. Another example? Cage and Laura Dern are having an argument just after he's let out of the slams. She's nervous and upset because she hasn't seen him in six years. He looks at her intently and tells her it's a mistake for them to get back together again. There is about a twenty-second closeup of Dern's magnificent blue eyes. They don't drip with tears. They don't even blink. They stare directly into the camera. Why? Like you, I'd have to guess. (I'd guess that her unblinking, unteary stare is meant to tell us that she sees things pretty clearly despite being shaken. That's pretty banal, I know, but my mind is open to other interpretations.)I don't mean to sound as if I'm bashing the movie because that's not what I mean to do. Let's linger a little over a much later scene. It takes place in the middle of a city street, El Paso I would guess, but it's one of those industrial-area streets that are deserted on weekends. It's a wide sun-baked silent street cluttered with drunken-looking telephone poles and lined with one-story factories and warehouses, and there is a city skyline way in the distant, cerulean with urban haze. And Cage is walking alone through this bleak and ominous landscape. But it's not only the visuals that makes this scene outstanding. A handful of viperous dudes wearing black fall in behind Cage's figure and another group of Thugees finally blocks his way in mid-street. The music comes to an abrupt halt. Nobody says anything. The atmosphere throbs with threat. Cage sets down his suitcase, takes the time to deliberately light a cigarette, looks around him, and asks, "Okay -- what do you faggots want?" What they want is to beat the hell out of him, and they get their wish. The unconscious Cage has a vision of The Nice Witch of the West (don't ask) and when he recovers he finds he's still surrounded by these sadistic brutes who ask him if he's had enough. He struggles to his feet, gingerly feeling his "broken" rubber nose, and says, "Yes, I've had enough. Furthermore, I'd like to apologize for referring to you dudes earlier as homosexuals. You've taught me a lesson." Then he runs away ecstatically. How many other movies can boast ten minutes worth of film like that?Now, I can see where a lot of ten-year-olds (or ten-year-old minds) might be bored with this film. It's long. There isn't an abundance of violence, although DaFoe does get his head blown off by twin blasts from a shotgun. I mean, quite literally, his head is blown completely off. It bounces off the wall like a football and lands with a loud splat on the pavement. So maybe there's a little hope for the horror afficionados after all, but not much, when you get right down to it.The movie is punctuated with violence and, even more, with oddities, but mostly it moves languorously. Cage and Dern thrum through the Texas night in a shiny old convertible whose radio plays nothing but news like, "A man won his appeal today for dismissal of charges that he ate his own child." Well -- not that, but equally weird. One relative of Dern gets his kicks by putting a cockroach directly on his nether orifice. Willem DaFoe should definitely sue his dental surgeon. He thrusts his mouth close to Dern's at one point, urging her to say something filthy to him and he'll let her go, and his mouth is like a limpet's, his lips a disgusting circle of membrane filled with hideous teeth.I wouldn't argue that "Wild at Heart" should be put into a time capsule, but it's not a movie that's easy to forget. David Lynch may or may not be a hot commercial property but he's one of the most original directors working today.
Wild at Heart is probably the most conventional David Lynch film I've seen. That being said, it still remains very far from mainstream. Wild at Heart revolved around a young couple, played to perfection by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Fast paced, mostly ridiculous, and pretty unrealistic, Wild at Heart is far from perfect, but a very fun film to watch.The premise is strange, but intriguing. A young couple is separated when the guy, an Elvis fanatic named Sailor (Nicolas Cage), goes to prison for manslaughter after defending himself against a man who threatened him. When he gets out, he is desperate to get Lula (Laura Dern), the girl he loves, back again. Lula is more than willing to pick up the relationship, but if her mother has anything to do with it, she won't have a chance. Being young and in love, the girl rebels. However, her mother's desperation leads her to contact a hit-man she is in knows and the young couple is forced to run away. The two lovebirds head to California and encounter all sorts of crazy situations along the way.Arguably the best thing about Wild at Heart is its great cast. Nicolas Cage is in his prime here and the role is, somewhat, reminiscent of the "repeat offender" he played in Raising Arizona. Nicolas Cage was great in his pre-action-hero movies. Laura Dern is equally excellent. I'd never understood the reason for her popularity in sexy roles. It's effective here, though, and she embodies sweet yet trashy Lula wonderfully. Supporting performances by Willem Defoe, Harry Dean Stanton, and Diane Ladd also provide liveliness that enhances the film.Although it deals with such serious subjects as murder, incest, and general family dysfunction, Wild at Heart is anything but serious. The film is chocked full of amusing moments and over the top clichés. The best example of this is the presence of a rich, older crime boss with a penchant for having young  preferably naked  young girls surrounding him at all times he's present. There are a few moments when the style gets repetitive and the characters do something worthy of much eye-rolling. Despite that, this movie is never boring and fairly unpredictable.Wild at Heart is a fun adventure to hitch a ride on. It is full of energy and snappy dialogue. Unlike most Lynch films, it is very linear and straight forward. The acting is excellent and the characters are strangely likable. Wild at Heart feels a little long and drags in a few places toward the end, but this barely hinders the film in its entirety. This is an amusing film, one that would make a good introduction to Lynch for those unfamiliar. For the rest of us, it's simply an enjoyable piece of film-making.8/10
Almost two years after beating a man to death in a fight, Sailor is released from prison and restarts his relationship with Lula - much to the disapproval of Lula's mother.  When Sailor and Lula break parole and head for California, she hires a hitman after them to kill Sailor.  Unaware of this, Sailor and Lula continue west, encountering all manner of weird and wonderful people on their way.I first tried to watch this when it first came on television, but I was watching it with family and felt uncomfortable with the nudity and turned it off.  Years later I have seen many other Lynch films, have loved Twin Peaks and looked forward to a chance to watch it.  I sat to watch it aware of the basic plot and that it was to be full of references to Wizard of Oz, but I wasn't prepared for the biggest surprise - that it just wasn't that good a film.  I am not adverse to Lynch's universe of weird characters but I don't like it when I get the feeling that he is simply being weird for the sake of it.Certainly that seemed to be the case here: the plot is so loose and meaningless to almost be pointless even as a frame for weirdness - which is what it really is.  The references to Wizard of Oz are all there but, rather than being part of the film, they are stuck in with clumsiness all the way - they seem like a gimmicky afterthought rather than a carefully scripted part of the film.  The plot is more a collected of the usual Lynchian weirdness and gore.  Sometimes this works really well when it is framed within an engaging film, but here the characters, images and action are all just left drifting in a relatively empty film.  It's a shame because I really like many of Lynch's films and was looking forward to this, but even I am forced to admit that this film just isn't that good.The cast features many of Lynch regulars, but many seem to be lost due to the fact that they haven't got the material to do their stuff within. Cage is really quite good despite his simple character.  Dern is given more to do but comes across rather hammy with it - her character should have had the emotional buy in to the film but she can't deliver it.  Turns from Dafoe, Stanton, Rossellini, Fenn, Glover and others are all good but they exist as free floating weird characters rather than part of the film in the way I would have liked.Overall this is a typical Lynchian film in it's imagery, weird characters, strange story and violent/sexual content.  Usually these would be good things in this context but here they aren't put together very well creating a film that, although worth seeing and weirdly fascinating, is not actually that good a film.
... over the years and it shows its age but the characters haven't been tamed and would still give you a coronary if you happened to bump into a couple of them, especially Bobby Peru!
This is how Lynch described his attraction to Gifford's book. It speaks just as well about every other film he made of course where a certain amount of fear makes the things to dream about stand out from the night as all the more urgent.It has enough going for it either way; a road movie given to us with a gonzo eye, crime and anguish as kitchen- sink ritual, archetypally American male and female avatars of sexual youth, a sense of wanting to just love but the world is a wicked place, and if that's not enough something else will come along in the next scene.It was awarded the top prize that year at Cannes. I would have to guess that the French saw some of this as archetypally tweaked America, quintessential in the fracture. It's the same audience that was going to receive Pulp Fiction with plaudits in a few years.And this is the whole thing. At this point Lynch could still be thought of as one among the quirky bunch that included the Coens, Stone and soon Tarantino. But can he be thought of as one of them now? No indeed and that's how much he has evolved.What sets Lynch apart is that others create movies as self-enclosed worlds; for Lynch it's rather one larger, open-ended world that he carries with him everywhere and now and then summons some part of it in movie form.The Coens for example, who are closest to him in several ways, both work with metaphysics and indulge loves for song, noir and dreams. Blue Velvet and Raizing Arizona, I can't think of one without the other, both with a dreamlike noir engine that skewers idyllic middle America. But the Coens think up a story and cleanly work out its mechanism, Lynch's work seems to come from prolonged stays in meditative habitation of that world. They are intellectuals, he's spiritual (not the same as pious).Except this one came from a book Lynch was given while finishing the Twin Peaks pilot and decided to do; not so much summoned from his world as he visited someone else's and came back with impressions. Now in my third viewing, it continues to be my least favorite of his post- Velvet long works that constitute the Lynch world but still one of the most endearing messes I know. It's Lynch letting out steam more than anything.But I'll keep with me the powerful noir engine that creates the fearful dreaming; two women, mother and daughter, who are traumatized by something they (she) allowed to happen (rape, husband's murder) and this is now spilling and surging through the film as helplessness to resist evil (most notably seen in the helplessness to avert the PI's death and the Bobby Peru scene). It does show Lynch as a humanist filmmaker, not a cynic, and that alone elevates it above mere carnage.
A real stimulatingly offbeat exhibition from Lynch is the dark and wild backdrop of a romantically engaged traveling pair: "Sailor" who is on parole after committing a brutal murder, and "Lula" whose mother demands her to return from a spoiled trip to Texas with help from a detective. It's a twisted, artsy journey that is often repulsive and long to boot (and certainly not for the squeamish!), but fares inventive at a certain degree and boasts some of the strongest performances ever worked on a Lynch film, perhaps even in 1990. Cage's concert act and the magically rendered semi-ending are two classic acclaims put together in this moving cinematic collage. RATING: * * *
David Lynch's films, although unsettling (intentionally) and occasionally off-putting, are usually very exciting to watch. He's such a visceral filmmaker, with an uncanny grasp of bringing personal nightmares right out into the daylight, that it sets an audience off. Viewers are immediately taken aback, and it takes a while to get used to his rhythm all over again whenever a new picture of his comes out. But "Wild at Heart" isn't even much of an attempt, and there's nothing gossamer or delicate about it, nothing mysterious; it seems to have been made by a truck driver, barreling his way through a traffic jam. Lynch's penchant for in-your-face vulgarity reaches its zenith; in fact, this is just vulgar bravado in search of a movie, with characters that are like fingernails raking a chalkboard. Lynch transposes "fairy tale" elements onto a mostly-familiar lovers-on-the-run story with Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern playing the sweethearts, anti-heroes trying to evade Dern's mother (the degraded Diane Ladd) but, alas, leaving havoc in their wake. Overlong and crummy-looking, the film is twisted, foul-mouthed...and yet much worse, it is debased. It's another chapter in Lynch's fascination with the classes (trailer-trash life vs. suburbia), with the requisite desert psychos and doomed Lolitas, but I found it incredibly repetitive and not all that wild. * from ****
If you know anything about the works of David Lynch you know that it's different often dark and it challenges the mind as the world is never what it seems to be. With this 1990 work "Wild at Heart" it shows just how dark and different life can be for some like it's a twist and parody a dark like "Wizard of Oz" journey like film!This film is very violent and erotic with intimate and wild raw sex scenes as it's a ride thru darkness and uncertainty. The story has Lula(Laura Dern) who loves and only wants to be with her ex-con boyfriend Sailor(Nick Cage) no matter how many times danger and death tries to get them. So both hit the road to find happiness only they find a wicked and cruel underworld awaits them on their road of journey.This film proves life is no fairy tale as it's a dark and wild wicked madness journey for many this movie is also supported well by Willem Dafoe, Harry Dean Stanton, Isabella Rossellini and many others overall it's a pretty good cult classic film to watch.
It's true to say that Wild At Heart is perhaps one of David Lynch's more-flawed cinematic endeavours, with many of the scenes and indeed, the film as a whole, seeming incomplete or lacking any real purpose. One criticism of the film that tends to crop up most often is that the whole thing smacks of "weirdness for weirdness sake", with Lynch failing to tie his strange characters and their surreal situations to any kind of real narrative, which, I suppose, is true. However, despite these flaws, the film is still a great deal of fun, and although the whole thing is ultimately very silly, it still has enough bizarre high-points, set-pieces, sight-gags and cameos to make the whole thing ultimately worthwhile.I suppose the film is best described as a vicious black-comedy, though the emphasis there is on 'vicious'. Lynch also makes allusions to the 'lovers on the run' genre of crime film-making popular in the 60's and 70's, taking it all further into the realms of the bizarre through his own cinematic obsessions (like deformities, arson, small-town Americana, detective fiction, good versus evil, car-accidents, etc), as well as more arcane references to Elvis, voodoo, incest, and the Wizard of Oz. It's a surreal trip, best summed up by the film's repeated mantra "wild at heart, weird on top" with Lynch seemingly revelling in this carnival of grotesques, whores, thugs and criminals, all gathered together in small-town New Mexico under a haze of blood and sex. American film critic Roger Ebert mockingly referred to the film as a "lurid melodrama, soap opera, exploitation put-on, and self-satire", which to me, sums up the film's most successful attributes. The plot takes off from films like Thieves Like Us, Bonnie & Clyde and Badlands, pre-dating Oliver Stone's similarly over-the-top dark-satire, Natural Born Killers, with two star-struck lovers hitting the road in an attempt to escape from the pressures of the modern-world (parole, poverty and an over-bearing mother). Lynch lays on the melodramatic clichés in broad stroke, to the point where all narrative references are to be taken with a pinch of salt... for example, it's not enough for our hero Sailor to be a murdering jail-bird from the wrong-side of the tracks, but he has to have a loving, sex-kitten girlfriend from a well-to-do neighbourhood with over-protective loved-ones. Admittedly, Lynch does subvert this almost saccharine depiction of moral family values by offering a flashback, in which our heroine, Lula, is assaulted by a predatory uncle, while her mother is later revealed to be a drunk, manic-depressive with mafia ties, which again, is all part of the joke.There's also the spirit of the 50's, with Fredrick Elmes' colourful wide-screen cinematography bringing to mind the Technicolor melodrama of Hollywood's golden age, and the films of people like Nicholas Ray, Elia Kazan and Douglas Sirk. There's also the obligatory references to the feckless youth of Brando in The Wild One, or the self-aware pastiche of Coppola's great film Rumble Fish, with the characters here looking and sounding like they've walked out of the pages of a lurid slice of pure pulp fiction. Of course, this is another problem that some viewers have had with the film, with Lynch offering no real characters - as he had done with masterpieces like The Elephant Man and Blue Velvet - and instead relying on arcane ciphers and bizarre caricatured grotesques. Again, this is all part of the fun and not really intended to be taken entirely seriously, with Lynch and his actors keeping the film moving from one out-burst of random surrealism to the next; with a number of humours and/or terrifying iconic performances from this esteemed, though certainly eclectic, cast of characters. The centre of the film, and indeed, the real focus of our attention, is established and sustained well through the relationship between the characters Sailor and Lula, which is developed surprisingly well through the strong and fearless performances of Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Dern has never looked more stunning in a film as the sensual and unhinged Lula, whilst Cage reminds us of what a strong and intense character actor he used to be in the days before he switched to shallow Hollywood blockbusters. Both actors have a great chemistry with each other, and create a believable relationship in spite of the over-the-top abstractions and dramatic flourishes called for by Lynch's script. Amongst the supporting players, Harry Dean Stanton is a joy as the hound-dog private-investigator Johnny Farragut, who is sent looking for Sailor and Lula by his lover, Lula's mother Marietta Fortune, who is brought vividly to life with a grand-standing over-the-top relish by Dern's real-life mother, Diane Ladd.Add some bizarre cameos from Lynch regulars, like Sherilyn Fenn, Jack Nance, Freddie Jones, Grace Zabriskie, Isabella Rossalini, Sheryl Lee (here continuing the Oz references with her climactic appearance as the good witch), J.E. Freeman, Crispin Glover (in one of the film's most bizarre scenes, as Lula's troubled cousin Dell), and an extended appearance by an unrecognisable Willem Dafoe, who's character Bobby Peru meets one of the most outlandish and overly violent sequences ever witnessed on screen. Certainly this film doesn't quite floor-me with it's madness as it used to when I was 14 or 15 (and would watch this and Blue Velvet pretty much religiously), with Lynch subsequently out-doing himself with the modern masterpiece Mulholland Drive. However, this film is probably more fun, and doesn't take as much concentration to really follow or get into it.Ultimately, the film works depending on how much of Lynch's bizarre creations you can stand; with the film falling somewhere between the darkly-comic satire of Twin Peaks at it's most wittiest and the dark, industrial nightmare of Lost Highway, only with a more linear plot. I still think it's a great deal of fun, and will undoubtedly appeal to die-hard Lynch fans or those with an interest in cult American cinema.
This was the most hyped film of 1990. It was considered one of the coolest films of the 90's. I saw it once when it came out and the only things I remembered was the car accident with Sherilyn Fenn and the angel at the end. That's it. I saw it again for the first time in 19 years and I understand why. It's not very memorable because it isn't a very good movie. Sure, there are some cool crazy characters (all right, they're all crazy!) and the photography of the bleak landscape is beautiful. David Lynch has also a cool way of using sounds and music which makes the film very eerie. Apart from that, the film is dangerously close to being a B-movie, almost laughable. It doesn't hold up.
The opening scene to Wild At Heart features Nick Cage ferociously beating an assassin to death. Heads are rammed against walls, fists are lunged into guts and what results is a brutally bashed corpse with brains pouring out of it's head. This kind of high-octane violence which is fueled by maniacal characters and deranged intervals creates a fantastic effect. One which has so much impact and so much individuality to it's merit that it turns out to be one hell of a movie.This is simultaneously a thrilling road movie and a revelation of small town, American country folk. The two protagonists, Sailor and Lula (Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern) are so in love with each other that they'd go to extreme lengths not to be separated. Their separation is exactly what Lula's crazed mother wants, as she believes that Sailor is a cold-blooded murderer who is putting her daughter in danger. Her anger is so fierce that the viewer becomes slightly scared by her: her manic fits of rage where she plasters herself in red lipstick; her bizarre paroxysms fueled by numerous cocktails. All of her slight idiosyncrasies and mannerisms well up to create a very intimidating mother. She sends out a hitman to dispose of Sailor and bring back her daughter, but the lovely couple are on the run from her and the law.Sailor and Lula meet up with some very strange characters whilst travelling far away from Lula's mother. The eccentricities of 'Tuna Town' in Texas, the insane car accident victim and Lula's nutcase cousin who believes that "the man with the black glove is coming to get him". It's all rudimentary David Lynch fare. He has mastered the art of contemporary film making: a clever blend of black-comedy, violence and fantasy.The viewer builds an empathy for the two main characters, as it would be a terrible thing to see their undying love for each other shattered. The other characters in the movie all seem to want to destroy that love. Sailor's character, although violent and hardbitten, seems the most normal of the lot. It takes a sane man to make sense of all the insane folk in America's underbelly. He puts up with a lot from everyone, but all he really wants to do is escape from it all with Lula.After all, who can love in a world that's wild at heart?Nine out of ten.
Wild at Heart (1990)An inventive, crazy, abusive, drugged up, violent, sexed up, romantic, anti-romantic, road trip pseudo noir campy intense up and down silly disturbing movie.But is it any good? Is it fun to watch, or moving, or beautiful? Maybe, if you are pre-disposed. At times I was amused or bemused or fascinating or surreal in a raw and theatrical way. It doesn't always add up, and even though it isn't meant to, the movie feels so self-indulgent you feel like the style is used to hide sloppy movie-making. It's a campy mess, really, with a whole slew of episodic turns and twists. You couldn't really care less about anyone or anything. It's too comic booky for that. Nick Cage is a bit too much to take, too...you might find him funny, or just overacting. There are some terrific performances--a hyped up, silly sexy Laura Dern, a hardened Isabella Rosselini, a characteristic Harry Dean Stanton, an unpredictable Willem Defoe, and so on, quite a quirky cast! A lot happens in two hours, and it has that wide open American landscape behind it. It's no doubt sexist, but I doubt any of its fans care a bit. And luckily, this kind of highly stylized film has its fans. Surely the glossy saturated nightmare and all the sex and violence is has all the earmarks of counterculture hedonism. That's good if you're into that. But I constantly think how much more powerful it could have been. There are moments, and scenes, that are fabulous, really brilliant. But in the long run it's a lazy movie, depending on its weirdness far too often. For me that's not enough. Curious, but not enough.
No one goes into a David Lynch movie expecting a normal viewing experience.But what do you come out with when you've seen a movie that cross-breeds a road movie with "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Wizard of Oz" and "Blue Velvet" (Lynch's previous film)?  Headache, nausea, dizziness and slurred speech, that's what.This is not a movie, it's a litmus test for how far a movie can go and how much it can get away with.  And obviously, the MPAA didn't let it get away with TOO much.  But enough, to be sure.As Sailor (Cage) and Lula (Dern) make their way through a bizarre world replete with oddball characters, twisted situations and nihilistic scenes of violence, it's kind of hard to juxtapose these with scenes of Glinda the Good Witch and Dern clicking her heels to get back home. 
Lynch tries to make a joke of the whole thing: blood, guts, severed hands and heads and all, but this is the kind of humor you're more apt to get if you're into jokes about death, dismemberment and a lack of overall morals. 
The only scene I did like in this whole mess is set in a dance club, where Cage roughs up a guy trying to put the moves on Dern, makes him apologize, has the guy get himself a beer and then jumps up with the band and breaks into an Elvis song while the girls in the club squeal and scream for joy. Seeing Cage sing like Elvis is worth the price of admission itself.Almost.One star.  For sheer guts, this movie has no equals, thank goodness.  But though it's "Wild at Heart", its "Heart" is not in the right place.  Just like its brain.
"Wild at Heart" is one deranged and twisted road trip as only David Lynch could bring you. It's so dark but at times funny too. Lula (Laura Dern) and Sailor (Nicholas Cage)are in love, but Lula's mother played by Laura Dern's real life mother Diane Ladd is evil. She doesn't want to see them together. Because of a murder, Sailor is finally released from prison. Lula's mom hires people to kill sailor. So Lula and Sailor go on a crazy road trip with dark and fellini like characters. William Defoe is unforgettable as the creepy and perverted Bobby Peru. The film almost received an X/NC-17 rating. It's easy to see why, it has lots of disturbing sex and violence. But than again that's a David Lynch trademark. This film is probably on my list of favorite road trip movies, next to Godard's "Weekend" (1967), "Thelma & Louise" and "Natural Born Killers". Both Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern give amazing performances. Dern's character Lula is the complete opposite of Sandy in "Blue Velvet", cause she's so wild and sexual. But Lula still has a naive child like charm. It seems that actor Nicholas Cage was born to play Sailor, a charming Elvis like ex convict who wants to change his ways. Also check out Berry Gifford's sequel to Wild at Heart, "Perdita Durango" (aka. dance with the devil) These films are both Wild at Heart and weird on Top!
Crazy ride through the seedy underbelly of trashy America as two sleazy dirtbags go on the lam from an even seedier and more sleazy mama. Loved Defoe's character, he was walking evil. The dude really lost his head during the bank robbery. Fascinating film, well written and played.
A bit of a weird one, this, but then what was I expecting from a David Lynch film? It's a surreal road movie starring Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern as a pair of star-crossed lovers on the run from Dern's demented mother and the string of assorted weirdos on their tail.I can't say I enjoyed this film all that much. I don't mind slightly crazed or surreal movies, like an earlier Nicolas Cage flick (and out-and-out comedy), RAISING ARIZONA. But WILD AT THE HEART feels like it's trying to be deliberately bad. Cage isn't in touch with reality at all in this one and Laura Dern just comes across as a bad actress.The direction is over the top throughout, with no measure of restraint on view. Lots of scenes are cheesy or just plain bad. It's not all bad, though, because we do get Willem Dafoe in an scene-stealing supporting role, and some decent set-pieces (like the bank job) along the way. But a lot of it, especially during the first hour, feels repetitive and slow, and the WIZARD OF OZ allusions are annoying more than anything.
David Lynch, that master of the bizarre, strikes again with "Wild at Heart". What I interpreted from it is that, no matter how weird a person is, s/he isn't as weird as the society that we inhabit. After all, Sailor is seen as the "wrong" kind of person for Lula, but the people hired by Marietta are also some real oddballs. Indeed, Sailor may have killed someone, but Marietta turns out to be the only truly creepy character: not only does she want to control Lula's life, but the way that she covers her entire face in lipstick is outright scary. And Bobby? Now that man's enough to make your skin crawl!If you want to take a more cynical approach to this, you could say that Lynch gave it the ending that audiences want as opposed to a more shocking one. But in reality, after what the movie says about our society, don't the protagonists deserve each other's love? Whether challenging the notion of an idealistic small town, or focusing on some sick people in the generally unseen parts of the US, this is not a movie that you're likely to forget soon. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern put on what were probably the best performances of their careers, with fine support from Diane Ladd, Harry Dean Stanton (RIP), Willem Dafoe, Crispin Glover, Isabella Rossellini and Sherilyn Fenn.Not the best movie ever made, but one that all cinephiles should watch at least once.
Wow! Let me think, what was the point of this film? Oh, I know, NOTHING! More David Lynch nonsense. The movie tells the story of two star crossed lovers that must go out on the road, so Lynch can use his lighting a match in the dark, headlights at night, and other lame trademarks. Typical Lynch, you keep wondering if there is a point out there, anywhere, but there is not. It is simply Lynch trying to make a cool movie. Using cool actors and cool music to make a cool waste of time. Why doesn't this guy just make music videos?
How to describe Industrial Symphony? Well, it almost defies description, in conventional terms, except that it's a story of broken love, and of a sort of floating angel (dream-self) singing of the inner-most feelings of love and happiness that are always out of reach. That's the basic description, I suppose, but what if I were to add that includes a dwarf sawing a log, or that the said angel gets "killed" (killed in quotes cause I don't know for sure, and I don't want to) and dumped in the trunk of an old 50s car, or that there's a big elk zombie at one point, or baby dolls that come down slowly with masks over their heads? That's just some of what makes up one of David Lynch's most under-seen efforts, where he experiments yet again by filming a live stage show- occasionally in 80's style slow-motion and dissolves like in a live music video of the period- and in using lighting effects and methods of 'storytelling' that are completely abstracted from anything you think you've seen before.First off, there is no "4th wall" in this world of the Industrial Symphony, far from it. As in Inland Empire, to which this shares a kinship in terms of how the lighting and production design goes, there's only a reality, and then an un-reality, and then the two possibly blended into another un-reality, or something like it. So it's, for lack of a simpler description, a dream-land where the peaks and terrors of love are meant to be taken in emotionally, not intellectually. And he provides us with a very talented singer, Julee Cruise, who would also appear on a couple of episodes of Twin Peaks. She helps put into some kind of context the story of Heartbroken Man (Nicolas Cage) and Heartbroken Woman (Laura Dern) after their break-up over the phone. Lynch then throws in these extra images, of destruction, death, of as naked woman writing on a car, a dwarf going busy sawing a log (as well as repeating in full accentuations the conversation that opens this special), and the dream-self singing from the trunk of a car into a TV camera. Finally, the last song is played over a rendition of the Twin Peaks theme, and it closes like any dream should, on the precipice of pure emotional catharsis.What this catharsis will do for some instead of others I can't say, but overall it marks as something to behold not just from Lynch who makes a great leap into theater direction and staging and using it as a crazy opera, but for Badalamenti who gets to spread his own creative ideas and melodies that stick in one's head long after it's done. My favorite was "I wan't you rockin' back into my heart", and the finale Twin Peaks theme, but the mid-segments that played, like the music over the sawing or the elk-zombie's uprising, plays like it's a cross between new-age sap and the most haunting 40's noir music around (and, perhaps, like music one would think is played over a tender sex scene in Twin Peaks). So, if you're a die-hard Lynch fan, track it down, and enter into what's described on the original pamphlet as a "triple-exposure dream." Whatever it is, it's a delirious, sumptuous testament to the heart, as corny as that sounds. Goofy at times, sure, but the humor there-in is outweighed by the grand theatrics of it all.
There are two sides to Lynch. One is the master who works in long, abstract form and gives us not just a world and some plot that takes place there but a world together with the mind that gives rise to it, creates agency from that mind that is itself at the mercy of that world.The other is the art school student, painter, sculptor, all around quirky guy who loves to populate these abstract forms with scrapyard theatrics and figures, log ladies and black-faced monsters behind the corner. It takes both of these Lynches to give us the truly mind-bending stuff that haunt.Here we have just the second Lynch. He got together with Angelo Badalamenti, secured a soundstage and staged a performance piece around dreamlike heartbreak. We have bodies suspended on strings, a midget who recites, a demonic figure dancing on stilts. Various hues of light, beams and flashes, an industrial feel. The good witch from Oz sings throughout.It has something akin to purpose, framed as it is as Lula and Sailor breaking up at the start, it was probably something he had fun with for a few weeks after finishing Wild at Heart. But it's a thin agency and mostly these forms mingling on a scrapyard stage, a bout of eccentricity.He would do a lot more of these in later years when he could just grab a digital camera, but it's when both Lynches are at work that I'm interested.
For some reason I tend to start disliking Lynch because I like his work so much. I went into this quite critical, as I didn't really expect much. But still.... Lynch just continues to enchant me as an artist. To explain what this is: Its a musical and a play, and its about a woman being brokenhearted as she's been left. The strength of the whole thing is the atmosphere. Really gripping and wonderful. There's fog all over the stage, and the haunting music is simply perfect. And of course the imagery.. and the lyrics. Its shocking, but attractive. You never really get whats going on though, its really dreamy. People floating in the air... and at one point there's a huge devil walking around on stage. When the haunting scene with the millions of dolls was strung down on the scene with creepy music alongside it was the point I personally was convinced that this is a masterpiece. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the further-out side of Lynch's work. The atmosphere in this one is just gripping.
This is a fantastic production that caught my eye because of my long love of 'Twin Peaks.'  Although it is actually unrelated to the show, 'Dream' has enough elements of 'Peaks' to make it seem to be an extension of the series. Julee Cruise, the otherworldly bar singer in 'Peaks,' stars as the dream-self of an otherwise average woman whose heart has been broken. Other familiarities from the series include Michael J. Anderson (the "little man from another place"), the song "Into the Night," and  the instrumental "Bookhouse Boys" used as the background to "Up in Flames."  I greatly enjoyed this fifty-minute trek back into the surrealism and sound that made the series so unique.
Ever wondered what it would be like if David Lynch put on a musical stage show with Julee Cruise? Look no further! Industrial Symphony is a supremely strange show put together by David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti for the annual Brooklyn Academy of Music. They only had two weeks to prepare for the show, and so the result is rather remarkable.It opens with Sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart on the phone, with Sailor leaving Lula. The rest of the film is an extended fever dream set on stage. It reminded me of a concert, only this is a concert by David Lynch so there's awful blonde wigs, half naked women gyrating on cars and dwarfs sawing logs. I found it rather fabulous.Julee's vocals are incredibly haunting and hypnotic. Match this with the visuals David presents us and it feels incredibly nightmarish. There's a moment where Julee stops and screams mid-song and falls from the rope suspending her from the ceiling. It's so jarring and it actually scared me a little bit. It doesn't help that she turns into some 30ft skinned papier-mâché deer either.The whole thing wouldn't have felt out of place if it appeared as a scene in Inland Empire, so that gives you an idea of its mesmerising weirdness. For Lynch fans, it's unmissable. For everyone else, it isn't.
A description of this project can only be, like descriptions of Lynch's other more obtuse works ("Inland Empire," "Lost Highway," "Fire Walk With Me" "Rabbits") a description of "what happens" during the running time, which is more or less a useless venture. Try to describe what you dreamed last night to a friend and watch his eyes glaze over. One would hope that someone watching this video has a vague idea what to expect...you don't go for a viewing of something by Lynch hoping for "Singing In The Rain" at the least.This project is definitely "out there," and like the other films mentioned is more or less non-narrative, more like a tone poem...what "meaning" there is to be found is probably up to the individual viewer. As I've said before about Lynch, only the dreamer of the dream can really guess accurately what any of it "means" to him, our experience can only be what the artist has filtered through. So what do we have? First and foremost, this recording, culled from two live performances Lynch was apparently commissioned to do, contains some of the wonderful, spooky songs written for and recorded by the ethereal Julee Cruise. The pyrotechnics, flashes of lighting, metal-on-metal surroundings, frustrated sexuality and typically Lynchian sound effects evoke an "industrial" dread that pre-sages Cronenberg's "Crash" a few years later. It is by turns perversely sexual, horrifically surreal, sweetly sentimental and slightly dull, and all within 50 minutes. The possible highlight is a song that plays like a sad lament for a lost era of 50's doo-wop, with two blasé prom-dressed girls and a chorus of vivacious Vegas showgirls.This is "Lynch-land," and if you like Lynch you'll probably enjoy it, if not you would probably find it pure torture...it looks a bit "90's" by today's standards, it is relentlessly dark and slow at times and I question how much forethought actually went into it (Lynch himself claims it was put together pretty fast) but it is inherently memorable...one is unlikely to forget some of the strong images, or the plaintive sighing of Julee as she floats through the air, the embodiment of an innocent heart broken, but not destroyed.
David Lynch's prequel to his TV Show 'Twin Peaks' drowns the viewer into the psyche of Laura Palmer, who was a crucial enigma of the series (but then again, 'Twin Peaks' is full of enigmas and riddles). The darkness of the human mind has been a consistent theme in many of Lynch's works. Other more recent examples include 'Mulholland Drive' and 'Inland Empire'. 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' is brutal, stark, graphic and horrifyingly disturbing.'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' may not be as technically 'polished' as Lynch's other films and the low budget shows (but is not bothersome at all). Yet, the closeups have a very strong effect as it provides some evidence of fine acting. Sheryl Lee is at the centre of the film and she is astonishingly superb. Someone should give this actress more roles. Ray Wise, Moira Kelly, Kyle Mclachlan and the rest of the supporting cast are of note. The visuals, even though this is during the pre-CGI boom, are mesmerizing. And of course, what would a Lynch film be without symbolism. They are plentiful but I won't give my interpretation as they are best discovered first hand.Many feel that the story is inconsistent but to me it all fits well together. Towards the end it is depressing, as the viewer has witnessed all the layers of Laura's agony in detail. It is not a comfortable film to watch. After all, she was just a normal American teenager who has experienced the worst of life and this movie grips the viewer and shows her life breaking into irreparable pieces. Yet, given the heavy theme 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' is a film worth experiencing, especially for fans of the series and Lynch's other works.
Having enjoyed the television series 'Twin Peaks' I was keen to see this as well as a little trepidations; could it possibly live up to the series? Now I have just finished watching it I'm not sure what to think; it was just that strange!The film doesn't open with the events in Twin Peaks but with the previous victim Teresa Banks; two FBI agents go to investigate her murder; one of them takes her body to Portland to be examined while the other stays being to ask a few more questions; this one then vanishes without a trace. Cooper is then put on the case. Moving forward a year the action heads to Twin Peaks where we see the final events leading up to the death of schoolgirl Laura Palmer.This may be set before the television series but it is best not to watch this first as it shows who killed Laura and that is the key mystery for most of the series it might be interesting to watch this before watching the series for a second time though. Since she died before the first episode Laura didn't feature much in the series but here she is the protagonist Sheryl Lee plays her once again and does a fine job depicting a girl who is terrified of what is happening around her but is powerless to stop it. Several cast members return although Donna is now played by Moira Kelly; she does a decent job but it is odd seeing somebody other than Lara Flynn Boyle in the role. Since no murder has been committed at the time we don't get to see any of the Sheriff's Department; nor do many other familiar faces.Many viewers may be surprised at just how strange this is, I certainly was! The opening scene sets the tone though when an FBI agent is given advice about his case by the appearance of a woman in a red dress she does not say a word; just makes a face and moves her hands a bit while walking on the spot! It isn't long before that seams positively normal there are visits to the Red Room which are not subtitled so it is hard to understand what is being said; there are similar difficulties during a long scene where loud music is played; this serves to increase the feeling of confusion; in a good way. It sounds a strange thing to say but I think I enjoyed this but I'll have to watch it again before I can be sure I'd recommend it to fans of Lynch's other works and fans of the series should definitely try it even if they might end up hating it!
By the time this film was released, critics and TV audiences had already decided its decidedly mediocre box-office fate. The usual network attitude toward anything which demands thought and interpretation assured the cancellation of the series in its second season, and Lynch's departure from the show's director's chair to begin this film project all but sealed the fate of the show. Unfortunately, this same fate determined both the critical and public approach to the film project. TP:FWWM is a prequel to the two-season Twin Peaks saga, and (sort of) answers the question 'how and why did Laura Palmer die?'. Fans of the show mostly knew the answers before they saw this film, but to see Laura's life so vividly realized, and to see the TV characters cast into such a different, more harsh, surreal and disturbing light, really invigorates the entire TP phenomenon. FWWM actually inspired me to watch the entire series again (and as of 2004, I am in the process of watching it again). Fans of the series who found themselves disappointed by the final few episodes of the series because they felt it became too bizarre, are likely to find this film more gripping, though they will probably end up as unsatisfied as they were at the onset. Those who found the second season thrillingly experimental are likely to be surprised by the subtlety of and dramatic quality of this film. Those, like me, who approach the film with few tangible expectations might just find themselves, compelled, disturbed, and very entertained. The performances are generally very good, but not entirely even. Some TV cast-members, given the vastly expanded possibilities of cinema, really showed their range and depth. Sheryl Lee, MacLachlan, Dana Ashbrook, and Ray Wise were especially impressive. The cinematography is less powerful than the usual Lynchian vision (see Eraserhead, Lost Highway for extreme examples), and is more in keeping with the TV show's straightforward, but moody, photographic approach. The overall production values are, in fact, comparable to those of Mulholland Drive - also originally planned by Lynch as a TV show. Though more subtle than many of Lynch's more extravagant works, TP:FWWM is very successfully manipulative and powerful. I ardently appreciate Lynch, considering him one of cinema and performance's greatest contemporary artists. And I am unashamed to state that I believe this to be among his finest works. Many of Lynch's fans love to write interpretations of Lynch himself, as if all of his films are in some way connected beyond the obvious fact that he directed (and more often than not scripted) them. I do not disagree with this approach, but, in my opinion, any such universalizing comments more or less miss the point. Lynch is one of many director's who view film as an art form, not as a craft, nor as a vehicle for specific messages and stories. As Lynch has stated, repeatedly, his films involve a dream-like reality and often attempt to invoke a dream or nightmare state in viewers. Unlike most, however, Lynch succeeds in the purity of his art. His films demand interpretation, engagement and, what's more, demand a different and unique interpretation by most who view them. If you are looking for something which can be universally interpreted from TP:FWWM as part of this imagined set of Lynchian themes, I am not the reviewer to give it, look elsewhere. I have too much respect for Lynch's artistry to subject him to my own interpretive explanations. If you are looking for a simple story which will clear up the insanity of Twin Peaks, don't bother with FWWM. If you are looking, open-mindedly, for an intense, disturbing, and well constructed cinematic experience which creates more questions than it answers, and retains elements of mystery in a fatalistically driven plot environment, you've come to the right place.
If you were not a fan of the Twin Peaks television series you would not want to bother watching this film. Fire Walk with Me pretty much requires the viewer to have already seen every episode of the television show. If you haven't you will be well and truly lost as you watch this film unfold in the bizarre Twin Peaks universe. Assuming you have the requisite working knowledge of all things Twin Peaks heading in you'll at least be able to understand the film. Whether you'll like the film is an iffy proposition at best.Fire Walk with Me is a prequel to the television series which means Laura Palmer is alive. But before we can get to Laura there's a thirty-minute or so prologue (a prequel within a prequel?) about the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks, whom all the Twin Peaks die-hards know was the first victim of the killer who would eventually murder Laura. After what any fan of the television show will see as some typical weirdness, and not much in the way of resolution, the prologue ends and we move forward in time, jumping into the final week of Laura Palmer's life. It's nice to see Laura alive for the first time. The television show had already established Laura was not the sweet, innocent homecoming queen she seemed but her demons were, for the most part, only hinted at on TV. In Fire Walk with Me those demons are on full display. Where the television show was subtle, the movie is in your face. A little too much in your face some might say as David Lynch takes full advantage of all the opportunities provided by producing an R-rated movie. Certainly nothing is held back here as we watch Laura Palmer spiral downward towards her sad end.In the rather brutal telling of the story of Laura Palmer's final days all the charm of the television series has been lost. For all the terrible things that occurred in the series the show always had that small-town, quirky charm. Not here. For the Twin Peaks fan it's nice to see those familiar characters again. And the film does add a lot to the Laura Palmer story and allows you to get to know her much better. But you may come away wishing you hadn't gotten to know her quite so well. Perhaps some things are better left unspoken and unseen. There were two sides of Laura Palmer and this film shows you much too much of the dark side. There was a lot of good in her, watching this film makes it hard to remember that even as you can't help but sympathize with the way she is being taken advantage of and the way she will meet her ultimate fate.If you're a real Twin Peaks fan you really do have to see the movie. There is a lot to like about it. The story is captivating as ever, if decidedly less charming in this go-around. And the performances from the cast are mostly very good, most notably from Sheryl Lee who finally gets to play a living, breathing Laura Palmer after having been introduced to the world dead and wrapped in plastic. And Ray Wise as Laura's father Leland also does fine work in portraying a disturbing and complicated character. We never got to see Leland and Laura interact in the series and their relationship is fascinating to watch. Fascinating and also more than a little creepy as the movie's Leland is a constantly ominous, threatening presence. You'll miss Lara Flynn Boyle who for the film has been replaced in the role of Donna by Moira Kelly. Kelly fails to bring the same spark to the character that Boyle did. And while many of the characters from the show return you'll miss those who notably don't. Audrey and Benjamin Horne, Sheriff Truman, Deputies Andy and Hawk, Doc Hayward and Pete Martell and Big Ed...would have been nice to see them and some others one last time if even just briefly. It is nice to have the opportunity to go back to the Twin Peaks universe. Unfortunately it's not quite the universe you remember. This is a much darker, sinister and decidedly less enjoyable Twin Peaks. Sometimes you can't go home again.
This remains my favorite of Lynch's "difficult" films of the last decade, which include "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Dr." Absolutely no one can establish a mood of dread like Lynch, and this film is superlative in this respect. Images, sound design, and Sheryl Lee's near-miraculous performance all contribute to something much closer to a Horror Film than the genre with the actual namesake.It seems that many fans of the Twin Peaks TV series were very disappointed with this film. I read over and over how "peakies" feel the movie lacks the "quirky, off-beat, kinda funny" tone of the TV series. Well, step back and consider something: the central themes of the movie AND the TV show are 1.) father-daughter incest, 2.) drug addiction, and 3.) murder. I guess we're all pretty desensitized, what with TV shows like "Law and Order" and Jerry Bruckheimer movies all purporting to give us action and thrills that are gritty and hard-bitten.Lemme tell ya, that stuff ain't gritty and hard-bitten. Rape victims on TV shows are paper-thin stereotypes compared to the Laura Palmer of "Fire Walk With Me." Why? Because Lynch shows us the HORROR, the inescapable, fenced-into-a-corner hysterical inevitableness of a young girl who can't cope with her father's abuse of her, who then turns to drugs and increasingly can't cope with those either, and who finally sees the true tragedy of her life before it's even finished playing out. The wings disappear from the picture.What "Fire Walk" offers in its portrait of evil and abuse is the full gamut of emotions, not just fear and anger (though there is plenty of that), but also aching, aching sadness, loneliness, abandonment. Lynch did a fairly good job of conveying this within the confines of a TV show with commercials (remember how the first half hour of the pilot was just people crying?), but in the movie he really gets to go town.Incest and drug abuse are absolutely devastating. This movie is absolutely devastating, and so touches the truth.
There's no doubt about it, Twin Peaks changed the living, breathing face and body of television, the soul and minds of those who watched it, and the attitudes of film and television makers everywhere, who watched what was intended to be a 2 hour Tele-movie become a phenomenon. A phenomenon that dissected the way television was made and shown to its very core, and reassembled it in a fashion that no one had ever witnessed, or dreamed of. A phenomenon that would sweep the world Not since JR was shot in Dallas had the entire worldwide viewing public stopped to ask itself a question, for one brief, shining, crystallized moment, in 1990 Who Killed Laura Palmer? And so, with David Lynch's Fire Walk With Me, the question is not Who? But rather, Why? This film precedes the TV show, these are the last 7 days of Laura Palmer, and after watching this film, it is pretty apparent why Laura wanted to die, she lived in a world out of her grasp and control, she was desperately fighting what she was becoming, but realized that the forces that were pulling her down, were too strong for her to fight against I knew someone like that once, and to be quite honest, it has changed the way I look at Laura Palmer. The first time I watched this film was in 1992 when it came out on VHS, I was 16 or 17 and I hated it. It wasn't Twin Peaks. It was horrible and violent and had none of the cuteness and quirkiness and lovable characters of the TV show, and I never watched it again. Watching it almost 15 years on, as an adult, I understand why I hated it so much when I was a kid. As a 16-17 year male, I had absolutely no concept or understanding of what it would be like to be Laura Palmer, completely unable to relate to her, and therefore completely unable to understand or sympathize. Completely unable to understand what it would mean to live in a world where everyone is in love with you, and how that would only make you hate yourself more, when you hate yourself so much already.This is a really sad movie. It really puts you in to Laura Palmer's world, or what's left of it, briefly. Maybe too brief, but, you know, maybe I read too much in to films, or I get too close too them, but this film has changed Twin Peaks for me forever. And it's quite possible that it will do the same for you. Even though she was dead before the opening credits, I never realized until watching this film again that Laura was never freed, she was always in 'purgatory' if you will, always in the Red Room when we saw her, or seeing a flashback of her murder during the course of the TV show. Fire Walk With Me gives something to Laura Palmer that she had been denied on television.Release.For the most part, this film was not made for the fans, nor was it made for the money, Lynch made this film for Laura palmer. His love of her is what inspired him to breathe life into her character on the big screen, after taking it away on the small. This is his dance, first and final, with Laura Palmer. It is not ours to be involved with, it is ours only to watch the romance between character and director evolve and be burnt too soon. It is ours only to witness, not too understand or judge, not to ask or question.From the opening shot, a television with no reception, which is quickly obliterated by an Axe, it is quite clear that this ain't no TV show, and if the symbolism of the TV being smashed isn't enough to tell you that, then the opening scene will. This is the part of Twin Peaks that simply never would have made it to TV. The real Twin Peaks, if you will, the dark, tortured, seedy underbelly of a town with too few people, and too many secrets, the sort of place that exists almost everywhere in the world (with the exception of Cicely, Alaska).
WARNING  SPOILERS!!Well I've just gotten the FWWM DVD and am finally able to appreciate the film as it was intended to be seen and heard (or at least as close as possible outside of a theatre).  It's unbelievable, and after watching it a few times I was finally able to understand for myself what Lynch was doing here, and he's right;  intuition is the key;  just pay close attention to what you are seeing and your mind will intuit the rest.  In fact, understanding this film was a truly exciting thing for me.  What Lynch is actually doing here is thrilling.  As much as Lynch would (and myself as well, but...) hate to hear someone give what they consider a definitive explanation for the film, I thought I would give some ideas about some of the most interesting moments.  Any interpretation is viable, of course, but this is how I look at it.First, the prologue: To understand the prologue one must understand something about the nature of the evil in this film.  I see the denizens of the Black Lodge as the physical embodiment of the subconscious.  That's what the Red Room is to me, the deepest levels of the subconscious, where there is an understanding going on that rational thought won't allow.  For example, Laura doesn't want to think that Bob is really her father, but deep down she knows (or comes to know in the film).  But Bob is really just the evil that men do, the darkest side of humanity, and he can be inside of anybody.  Since Bob is just a personification of this idea and doesn't literally exist, he really can't be caught, because eradicating Bob (and the other members of the Black Lodge) would be eradicating all the pain and suffering in this world, and that will never happen.In the prologue, Chet Desmond and Sam Stanley come across perhaps the most unhelpful town on the planet.  Much has been made of how this place is purposefully the opposite of Twin Peaks, but I don't think that's the point. The unhelpfulness is the result of the town knowing that no matter how many FBI agents are brought in, you can't get rid of what killed Theresa Banks; you can't get rid of violence.  They treat the two with disdain because they realize the fruitlessness of their search.  Lynch emphasizes the strict use of code (Lil) and constantly has characters asking what time it is to give an air of precision, but nothing gets accomplished.  The electricity reference is simply marking the presence of something bad in the area. So, a lot of investigation occurs with nothing being accomplished.  Theresa Banks is dead and will remain so.Perhaps the most obscure point in the film is the sequence with David Bowie. To make this short, Cooper's image freezes in the security camera because the members of the Black Lodge have stopped time for a second, also apparently causing a rip in whatever fabric divides this world and the Lodge.  This allows Jeffries to breifly crossover, apparently while the members of the Lodge are having a meeting.  This bizarre meeting with the grandson, Bob, etc.  is happening at the same time Jeffries appears in FBI headquarters.  He says it in voiceover:  "I've been to one of their meetings".  The meeting is to choose another victim.  The Man from Another Place is telling Bob to get more Garmonbozia (pain and suffering, which takes the form of creamed corn) for him.  "With this ring, I thee wed", he says, talking about Laura.  "Fell a victim", says the grandson, also talking about her.  The man in the chair with the beard makes a bizarre hand motion, as if saying "and so it shall be done".  Bob and The Man from Another Place are shown walking through the Red Room, on their way out after the meeting, to go get Laura.  The meeting over, the rip closes, and Jeffries goes back to the Lodge.  Keep in mind however that none of this is really literal, although you have to talk about it that way in the context of the scene. It's the film's way of saying that something bad is happening again, someone else is going to be the victim of violence.  The monkey underneath the mask is sort of like a fetus, or like a birth.  They've given birth to this evil which will grow and grow and grow until Laura is murdered, and the garmonbozia is given to The Man from Another Place.  After this, the murderous thirst is quenched, and the monkey reappears, indicating that things are once again calm but will once again grow (this happens at the end of the film). And of course in the series, Madeline dies.Some quicker explanations:  Laura talking to Harold, saying "Fire Walk with Me, ME!!"  is her talking about her temptation to degrade herself.  "He says he wants to be me or he'll kill me".  This is Lynch telling us in an incredibly unique way that the abuse she's had from her father is turning into self abuse.The old lady and the grandson are like the gatekeepers of the Black Lodge, allowing one to enter and exit.  In the literal world, they are Laura's very first inclinations that Bob may be her father.  The picture is just saying that she needs to go into her subconscious to find the answer, which she does that night.  "Don't take the ring", says Cooper (meaning don't be another victim; do something about your situation).  After Annie appears, Laura walks toward her door.  On the soundtrack you can hear her mom calling Laura, which references the morning after she was murdered and her mom couldn't find her.  She looks out at the stairs;  in about two days, her mom will come up these stairs to find Luara missing.  She is also in the picture looking out the door, meaning she has exited the Black Lodge, or her deepest subconscious, and is back in the rational world, almost.  This is her first realization that things might get really bad soon.Anyway, just some observations, but I'm probably running out of words, so I'll stop now.
Not Lynch at his best(that would be Blue Velvet, though personal favourite is The Elephant Man), it is a very good film and should please fans of the TV series, even if darker in tone and lacking the show's humour. Lynch's films may be strange, unconventional and not always easy to understand for some, but all of them are visually striking, dynamically scored and with great performances, atmosphere and direction as well as working amazingly as mood pieces and being among the most unique films in existence- the only film of his that I didn't care for was Dune, was mixed on Inland Empire too but that still had a lot of the above components.Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me may not be as good as the TV series but did not deserve the negative reception it got at the time. The few flaws it has has nothing to do with being darker and lacking the show's humour, they are not even flaws. David Bowie did stick out like a sore thumb and to me was embarrassingly bad(though a lot of it was to do with how his character was written) but the film's biggest flaw was that you could tell that it was originally written as a much longer film, with so much truncated there were parts where things felt under-explained and incomplete, a longer length would have helped(personal opinion of course and not one other people will share).Coming onto however what was good about Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, the film does everything else right. As said before, Lynch's films are always visually great, and to say that Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me looks great visually is not enough. The film in fact has wonderfully moody cinematography and lovingly designed sets, while the surreal imagery looks so mesmerising that regardless of whether the story confuses you you cannot possibly look away. Lynch's direction as ever is impeccable, his style unmistakable and the haunting soundtrack draws you in effortlessly. The story won't be everyone's cup of tea, I did find myself completely engrossed and found it along with Sophie Scholl: The Final Days one of the most powerful films personally seen in a while. Sure, it did feel under-explained and incomplete in parts but it never bored me and like every other Lynch film as a mood piece it's amazing. Parts were incredibly intense and shocking(the most intense parts making for one of the most disturbing films there is) but others were genuinely emotional as well. Regarding individual scenes in a film where one hypnotic scene follows another, the strobe-lit disco degradation stuck out in particular.Apart from Bowie, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is very well-acted, Sheryl Lee is superb and at times heart-breaking as an easy-to-root-for character while Ray Wise is just terrifying as one of the scariest father figures on film. Harry Dean Stanton, Kiefer Sutherland and Kyle MacLauchlan are on fun form too. In conclusion, a very under-appreciated film and undeservedly so. 8/10 Bethany Cox
Bob, Agent Cooper, Laura Palmer, Teresa Banks, The Man From Another Place, etc...Welcome back to David Lynch's offbeat town of TWIN PEAKS.Much darker than the TV series, this film was in part meant to answer many previously unanswered questions, but if anything - in typical Lynch fashion - it tangles things even further, and confuses matters all round.Lynch apparently shot more than 5 hours of the feature, and as much of these deleted/extended/alternative scenes are still missing, the movie we're left with feels rather bare and rushed.The performances are excellent, and the movie is visually stunning, and as usual the plot - while confusing - is intense and riveting.But alas it could have been so so so much more.... (sighs)
This is one of David Lynch's finest films. Considering the popularity of the This is one of David Lynch's finest films. Considering the popularity of the "Twin Peaks" TV series, this would seem a hard act to follow. As usual, Lynch doesn't fail to intrigue and push the envelope even further. The film does pander to those who wanted to see the last seven days of Laura Palmer's life, but it also sets many subplots in motion which were hinted at during the series. "Fire Walk With Me" is much, much darker than the series in terms of style, direction, plot, acting, humour and cinematography, and in many ways stands independently of the series. The beauty is that one does not need the other. They are both memorable in their own ways, similar in some but extremely different in others.This film works most efficiently if you have seen both seasons of the "Twin Peaks" series, as it's power resides in the inevitability of Laura's demise (this is not to say it is by the numbers and there are no surprises in store) and images from the later episodes of the series (which, yes, occur a long time later chronologically). It is considerably darker, however, than the series with the humor more or less restricted to the opening half hour, which sets up the entire "Twin Peaks" story, but once Laura Palmer is introduced, the story is (appropriately, to say the least) extremely dark and void of the light tone which characterized the television series. It is, like much of David Lynch's canon, a film that will surprise you and find beauty and truth in the strangest images and places. As long as you are aware of Lynch's earlier work (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Dune or The Elephant Man), the darker scenes/moments should not come as too much of a surprise. If you expect more of the TV series, you will, I'm afraid, be disappointed. But with an open mind, you will enjoy this film on it's own, strong merits.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.
Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a feature film prequel to the television series Twin Peaks. The film shows the last week of a high school teenager named Laura Palmer. Laura does drugs and balances life with her male friends and her best friend Donna. Laura is also really cautious around her overbearing and creepy father. She also seems to get weird visions and nightmares on top of things, so her life is pretty complicated and she is a pretty disturbed teenager. At the end of the film it ends where the Twin Peaks television show starts with the investigation of her murder. Winner of The Saturn Award for Best Music at The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films; The Brit Award for Best soundtrack at The Brit Awards and The Independent Spirit Award for Best Original Score. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and film editing. I have never seen the Twin Peaks television series before, but I really wanted to see this film because I figured I wouldn't have had to have seen the TV show seeing as this is a prequel and I also wanted to see the film because I love the films by the film's writer/director David Lynch. The film is hard to describe in many ways because like so many of David Lynch's films it is very unusual and is sometimes hard to figure out. But I was intrigued by this movie and I liked the character's dialog and the eeriness of the town and the different people who live there. The film is very well crafted and put together and I like how David Lynch was able to put together such an atmospheric and stylish film. Also to write a movie this interesting and off the wall takes the genius of a great writer and director such as David Lynch. I was thoroughly captivated by the film and entertained. I was also fascinated by this wonderfully unique journey into this odd little town with odd little characters and settings. A truly unique film experience and another hit for David Lynch.
Since the first line of TP:FWWM is "Get me Agent Chester Desmond in Fargo, North Dakota," some might argue that I am biased in my praise for one of Lynch's most underrated motion pictures.  The truth is, my life has never been the same since the fateful midnight in high school when I experienced Eraserhead for the first time.  TP:FWWM was savaged by most critics, who are unlikely ever to laud the unconventional Lynch again (unless he makes another film that connects like Blue Velvet).  Few other filmmakers have had the ability to depict so tangibly the intangibility of our dreams and the worlds contained therein.  Couple this with Lynch's corner on the "uncanny" market, and you have TP:FWWM, a film impossible to confuse with any other. My only complaint concerns the absence of Ben and Audrey Horne, who were such interesting and engaging characters on the television series.
They say it's a prequel to the series Twin Peaks. However, it is in stark contrast to the hit series. This movie is dark and raw, colors are flat, nothing comes close to the slick looks of the series. It is almost a ritual farewell by David Lynch regarding his Twin Peaks the series. Gone is that fairy tale like feeling of the series, this movie is B-style in your face drama with typical Lynch weirdness.If anything it's prequel to Lost Highway and Mulholland drive. Disturbing images, road rage, shots of a highway at night. Twisted characters. Nothing makes sense at first, you cannot take it literally, you have to read into it. When stripped of its madness, what's left is a tale of an abusive father, raping his daughter. And she uses drugs to escape this reality and ends up in the darkness of our lives. A side we all know is there, but try to deny for as long as possible. The opposite of the fairy tale so to speak.So if you're a fan of the series, this one might just be too raw for the senses. Expect violence, nudity, drugs and disturbing images.
Frightening and surreal film about incest. Sheryl Lee is astonishingly brilliant in this movie , she should be cast more often in films. I would consider it to be one of Lynch's best.
This movie is very difficult to find where I live but after I have fallen in love with the brilliant series and all the other works that David Lynch has done, I was really looking forward to watch this prequel that many professionals had heavily criticized. Many people said that the movie didn't have the same charming way of the life in a small and mysterious town, many people commented that the characters weren't as intense and believable as in the series and some people regretted that some of the series's characters like Audrey Horne or Harry Truman didn't appear in this movie and that some other main characters like Dale Cooper only had small roles.But I think that those people didn't understand the intention of this movie. It is sure that a movie of two hours and fifteen minutes can't develop the characters as much as a series with almost thirty episodes. It is also sure that this movie is about the last days of Laura Palmer and that's why characters like Audrey Horne have not much to do with this movie as they had no closer connection to the main character. This movie has a faster development than its series, it is straight forward and maybe less mysterious.But this movie is intense in every sense of the word. It is frightening, has a very dark and desperate atmosphere, it is horrifying and it is brilliantly played by Sheryl Lee and we get a true insight of the character of Laura Palmer and her everyday life along side her strange father, her weak mother, her many different friends and especially boyfriends. This movie shows in a very straight and hard way the wasted life of a beauty that has lost its youth and innocence. This movie is about sex, drugs, violence, crime, murder and fear and how to get drowned in a circle of desperation. The scene were Laura and Donna are in the discotheque is one if the most intense moments ever filmed in cinema's history with its strange music, weird light effects, ugly sex and violence scenes and the feelings that evolve from there. You feel hypnotized and desperate about the characters. The scene where Laura and her father are in their car and surprised by a strange one-armed man is strange, disturbing and extremely weird. The scene where Laura meets the strange Bob in her sleeping room is spooky, haunting and could create nightmares. The scene where Laura finally faces her destiny is brutal, uneasy and pervert. The conclusion and final scene of the movie is the only part where you feel a little bit of piece and hope in a very transcendent and spiritual way.David Lynch plays with your emotions and your wildest dreams and drowns you from one feeling to the other. While watching this movie I was frightened, I was almost crying, I was disturbed, I was delighted and I was absolutely impressed. I never thought that this movie would mess up with the best series in history but this flick is absolutely at the same level even if it is different because of its intensity.But even though this movie is straight and heavy, there are still many mysterious details and typical trademarks of the series from time to time like the weird introduction of the case by Gordon Cole and the dancing lady, things that only a genius could have invented. The weird scene with David Bowie is also one for the ages and extremely cool. There are also many little hints to discover that concern the fate of other characters of the series for example the scene where a bloody Annie sleeps next to Laura and transmits her a strange message.A sure thing is that this movie is no easy stuff and more scaring than any horror movie I have seen in my life. That's why this movie hasn't been a success for the masses and its very particular style is in fact very charismatic and different from anything you might expect. The point of desperation is that you know what will happen if you have seen the series and that you know that the characters are damned or even lost and the frightening about all of this is that you know that there is no escape and that you don't exactly know how or when it might happen. I really felt with the characters in this movie and this is something that has been developed in the series over several episodes but in this movie, I had the same feeling only after a couple of minutes. I have never seen or felt something as intense and strong concerning a movie in my whole life.I always thought that David Lynch's masterpiece concerning a movie is "Lost highway" but after watching this flick I am no longer sure about it. This is a masterpiece, a mysterious, weird, scaring horror movie with some dramatic elements. This movie doesn't need much blood or gore effects to frighten you, it's all about the atmosphere. This movie is so intense that you simply don't have the time to miss Audrey Horne and all the others that I have liked so much throughout the series. That is something brilliant and unexpected that only David Lynch could create and it's a shame but as well typical for the mainstream masses that they didn't accept this style at the time and that there haven't been any more movies about Twin Peaks. At least, the legacy found its end on an absolute climax.I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies and has a little sense of genius and is open-minded enough to accept the flick's very unique style. It is probably my favourite movie of all times or comes at least quite close to it.
Sheryl Lee's performance in this movie is surreal. She's graceful, disturbed, and fearless all at once. Her attempts to fight against the evil chasing her are simultaneously desperate and confident.The missing pieces are essential to enjoying the whole crazy ride that is Fire Walk With Me. If you enjoy Laura's story and POV, I'd suggest reading the Secret Diary as well.As always, you hate it or you love it with David Lynch. I can't believe this movie receives such flack with such fine performances and visuals from all involved.
It seems that when this prequel to the 'Twin Peaks' TV series was released in 1992 it didn't go down very well either critically or commercially. The series had been cancelled after season two a year beforehand so 'Twin Peaks' fever had died down considerably. Yet it seems that many of the fans of the show were disappointed with Fire Walk With Me anyway and I am guessing it was primarily for three reasons (1) it was tonally very different from the show - weirder, much harsher and more confrontationally disturbing, (2) it did not feature many of the loved characters from the series and (3) it did not resolve the cliff-hanger posed at the end of season two, instead it went back in time and detailed the last few days in the life of Laura Palmer. The latter reason was simply because director/creator David Lynch was most interested in the character of Laura Palmer and he wished to revisit her over and above anything else. Consequently, it's hardly surprising that the film only focuses on characters that were vital to Laura's last seven days, while the nature and reasons for her murder mean that the material was always going to be a lot more intense and disturbing. It's probably no coincidence that this film begins with a TV being smashed - from the outset it's clear that this is to be a definite re-imagining of the Twin Peaks universe.I myself am a big fan of Fire Walk With Me. It's much stranger than the series as well as being tougher. The freedoms of cinema allowed for this and TV was a great deal more restrictive content-wise back in the early 90's. On many occasions it goes very left-field and certainly does not explain all events in a neatly presented fashion. In this sense it ties in with much of Lynch's other film output. The weird moments are often very well executed and once more show the spectacular imagination of the man. But the bizarre aspects never take away from the basic story-line which does follow a linear path more or less. The story is at its heart a very dark and depressing one, after all it is largely about the systematic incestual sexual abuse of a young woman and her subsequent downward spiral. The surreal presentation adds considerable horror genre elements but distances us from the realistic true horror of the abuse. At this juncture it should be said that the acting of Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer) and Ray Wise (Leyland Palmer) is extremely impressive and a considerable step-up from the TV show. Lee is in most scenes and has a very wide range of emotions to convey, while Wise is simply terrifying as her abusive father.I am pleased that Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me has been enjoying something of a critical reassessment in recent years. It's so far on from Peaks mania that I think it's much easier to now see more clearly the strengths of this film. It fits into the filmography of Lynch extremely well and in many ways is one of his most interesting. As a finale to the 'Twin Peaks' phenomena it actually feels very apt and was a very satisfying way to finish things off.
I had heard much about the cult television series "Twin Peaks", and decided to buy the First Season on DVD. When I found that none of the stores near me had it in stock, I decided to pick up the movie instead. In some ways, this was good. In some, it was bad. Let me explain ...In 1991, "Twin Peaks" was canceled. Immediately popular director David Lynch, who also created and wrote most of the show, said that he wasn't finished with the show yet ... and set to work making a movie that would close off the "Twin Peaks" phenomenon. "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" - this film - is the result, a 135 minute journey into a realm where insanity and madness reign supreme."Fire Walk With Me" is a prequel to "Twin Peaks". The first thirty minutes deal with two FBI agents, Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland), who are investigating the murder of a young girl in the small town of Twin Peaks. Just when Desmond seems to have a suspect, we fade out and find that we are months later. From there, the film follows the events leading up to the mysterious death of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), which the series focused on. Kyle MacLachlan has some screen time as the series' main character, Dale Cooper.This is probably the hardest film to review in the world. First of all, let me say that if you aren't a fan of "Twin Peaks" or of David Lynch, you will be lost shortly after the film begins. This movie was created solely for "Twin Peaks" lovers, and if you haven't seen the show, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer is unveiled in this movie.If ever there has been a movie that is pure insanity, it is this. "Fire Walk With Me" is one-hundred percent madness. And yet, throughout the whole film, I was completely mesmerized. And when the movie ended, I couldn't speak or do anything for about an hour. This movie truly has an effect on you, whether you're a fan of the show or not.The cast is terrific, but it's David Lynch and Angelo Baladamenti who steal the show. Lynch is either a madman or a genius - I can't decide between the two. But Baladamenti is certainly a master composer, because his score for this film is beautiful.Seeing is believing. That fits perfectly from this film. Perhaps after I watch the show, I will better understand this film. Until then, I can just say that it the most indescribable, frightening, mesmerizing, and astonishing film I've ever seen.
If you are currently watching "Twin Peaks" on Showtime and are a little confused then you should watch "Fire Walk With Me". As much as I am enjoying some of the new episodes of "Twin Peaks" it is a little strange!I know people that have never seen the show before are saying one thing "What the Hell"? I can't blame them because the show seems to be catering to the die hard fans of the show. Most of all it is catering to people that know and remember every character from not only the show but the film "Fire Walk With Me". Now I was always a fan of the television show. I was mad that the show had ended with a cliffhanger. I was happy to hear that "Fire Walk With Me" was coming. A year later when it was released I was shocked that it did not solve the television cliffhanger however I did enjoy the film. I thought it was strange but very good. Fans of the show hated "Fire" because most the cast from the television show were not featured. It also din't help that the film was too violent for some fans. In the television show it was about "Who killed Laura Palmer. "Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me" The film was about why she murdered. I will admit the film is very confusing. The GREEN RING was a new element that was never mentioned in the television show. Also what was really annoying to me was that the murder of Laura slightly differs from what we were told on the television show. In the television show we are told (Through Waldo the Bird) that Laura kept saying "Leo No" and that Laura had a poker chip in her stomach. These events are not shown in "Fire". The assembly cut of the film was rumored to have run over 5 hours. When the the film was released it ran 135 minutes. Most of all the film did not resolve the cliffhanger from the television show. Before the film was released in the USA it Premiered at the "Cannes Film Festival" and it was booed. Now I am not sure if they saw a different version of "Fire" but the film was panned everywhere. This was a shock to David because the pilot to the television show was "The Best Reviewed" television pilot of all time. Well most fans had herd before "Fire's" release was that there was many cut scenes that featured the television cast. For years the fans were hoping that those scenes would turn up somewhere. BE it an extended television cut of the film or a special edition on home video. After all in 1984 David Lynch directed the film "Dune". A few years later when the film when shown on television it had about an hour of never before seen footage so hopes were high that this would be the case for "Fire" but that never happened until 2014 when David Lynch finally released the deleted footage. This was 22 years after the film was released. However these scenes were not edited back into the film. David Lynch likes the theatrical cut of "Fire" so he did not want to tamper with it. However fans did and someone who goes by Q2 made a great edit that included the deleted scenes and in reality it is a better film however, it does run 3 1/2 hours! Best News is that it does solve the cliffhanger from the television show! What is strange is that for a fan edit is that it runs smoother than the theatrical edition. The original theatrical version is shorter but seems longer! Now there is a few scenes that were re- edited back in that were not needed. On the plus side the fan edit does improve the viewers vision on the problems that Laura had to face in the last 7 days of her life! If you ever get the chance to see this edit it is worth watching, It makes "Fire" a masterpiece!
This isn't just the darkest lynch film ever made, it is one of the darkest, most disturbing films ever committed to celluloid. It tells the tale of the last 7 days of Laura Palmer, so it plays as a prequel to the episodic story which told the tale of how her murder was 'a feak accident' (described in this film). The films contains some of Lynch's most creative touches to date, most notably in a nightclub (from hell) scene, in which the character's dialogue is bareley audible, and in a dream sequence which involves a bizarre painting of a wall. Why Lynch fans overlooked this is more bizzare than the film itself, as it attains a similar style, but does admittedly drop a lot of the characters that gave it it's quirky charm (Dale Cooper has merely a walk on cameo, no sign of 'damn fine cherry pie') but nonetheless has a sense of bizzare horror and dread and plays out quite similarly as how you'd imagine 'the Exorcist; the Adolescent Years. After touches of subtle horror that Lynch has displayed in most of his films, this is a return to the 'bizzarly terrifying' sense of dread that Lynch demonstrated with Eraserhead, but unlike that film it is very true to form in portraying a slow journey of a downward spiral as seen through the perspective of a confused teenage girl- caught up in unfortunate circumstances due to her effortless sensuality, and in doing so it is so disturbingly authentic young girls heading towards a similar fate may use it as an effective warning. Criminally underrated.
This stands as an independent movie that can be watched even without any knowledge of TV show, but in that case, you probably won't like it. It is meant for fans of series and it rounds it perfectly. Chronologically, the movie is a prequel to the show, but in my opinion, it is the perfect final episode. It is significantly darker and heavier than series and it lacks that distinctive charm and atmosphere we got to love during original series, but it does not make it any less awesome. My only objection is the new actress in Dona role, cause she's not anywhere close to looks, charm and energy Lara Flynn Boyle had. Besides that, I'm sorry that movie does not show a bunch of characters from series that, I'm sure, we all wanted to see one last time. Many of them were included in the shooting of this movie but their scenes were cut in the final version. This is a very good movie, but I would not recommend watching it without a thorough knowledge of the previous TV show.8/10
This is one of those films that stays in your mind for days, maybe months. It can be described as haunting, disturbing, scary, hard to understand. It's typical Lynch with a macabre atmosphere surrounding it.The plot is hard to understand at first but then it gets very interesting and you get to understand the metaphors and the principal character's mental condition.There are plenty of horror elements such as B.O.B. and his freaky appearances (love the "fire walk with me" sequence, brrrr). There are highly sensual moments, exceptional cop investigation, and the usual WTF moments like the nightmare (it has even been parodied by "The Simpsons"): The ending is absolutely mind blowing and I rank it very high amongst those endings that leave you cold.The score by Angelo Baladametti is wonderful! The Direction is as always perfect. Lynch creates his own world and we are free to roam around it.Give the opportunity to this groundbreaking film. I wonder if the highly coveted "Black Swan" was inspired by this little gem.
Spoilers herein.Lynch's vision always consists of two worlds, clearly differentiated but enfolded. This has been the case in every project (though very subtle in `Straight'). In `Drive,' one world was real, the other imagined. In `Velvet,' the solution was to pit two film genres against each other.
Here, the two worlds are derived from the King Arthur legend, the source of all magical folding in literature. Every element here is from that legend: the log, the backwards time, the chamber, the ring, the sexual conflict.The timeframes are folded, from the instant of Lynch's imagining the story during a spoonful of corn, to a few days in the life of the hapless girl, to the `film/video' time which the investigators (including us) enter and are dissolved. It is all rather clever, but less so than other Lynch voyages to my mind. The one thing that really grabbed me was the prologue: the setup of the initial investigators (who diffuse into the dissolved space between realities) and their own abstraction of the story -- that dancing girl.That is novel, an invention unique in all filmdom to Lynch. That blue rose is what lasts in my visual memory when all of the relatively artless photography has faded. One example of the artlessness of the vision itself: the blunt device of blue haze when shifting realities. Another: the scan of debris on the floor of the One Eyed Jacks after the night of debauchery. This is extremely watered down Tarkovsky (from `The Mirror').That Canadian retreat: The One Eyed Jacks, is a reference to the first modern double reality in film. See my comment of that film (`One Eyed Jacks'), to see the conflict between the creole film worlds of Brando and Kubrick that Lynch inhabits.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.
I lack the ability to objectively scrutinize this film's value on a movie-goers' level. This film's artistry took me beyond the aesthetic and intellectual, and into a phsychological landscape I haven't been before or since.One must grasp the chaos, or have been a witness to it in their own reality, to feel the depth of this film and Lynch's use of contrasting landscapes of innocence vs. evil, duality, contradiction, femininity, nostalgia, Etc., that somehow manage to make perfect sense: as long as we don't try to make sense of it. This film is about getting lost. It must be intuited, felt in the dark, to be truly appreciated. It's the only cinematic experience that I call "magical". I was unable to review this in an impersonal way.Besides that, and for those who don't really "get it", the acting, directing, production, writing, plot, Etc. all make the film worth seeing more than once. But those are just the little things.
I'm a huge David Lynch fan ("Mulholland Drive", "Eraserhead"), and while unabashedly love the first season and a half of the groundbreaking TV show Twin Peaks, it took me a long time to get through the latter half of the second season of the aforementioned show because it sort of started to go off the rails when Lynch wasn't steering the ship. Just to give you a sense of timing: it took me about two weeks to get through the first season and a half (first eighteen episodes), and then after I found out who killed Laura Palmer and why, it took me almost a year to finish those final twelve episodes. I did finally finish those less-than-stellar episodes, and I was surprised to find that despite my relative disappointment with most of season two, the series finale was pretty great, and it left me eagerly awaiting this film, and then completing my Twin Peaks journey with Twin Peaks: The Return (I'm only a few episodes in so far, but it's fantastic). I was so excited after the season two finale that I jumped right from that episode to this movie (like I'm sure many of the hardcore fans of the series did when this film hit theaters).As a whole, I'm sort of conflicted about this movie. I think it's a very good companion piece to Twin Peaks, as it tells the story of Laura Palmer's final days leading up to her murder from Laura's perspective, revealing all of the information we learned about Laura and Twin Peaks in an easily digestible two-hour-and-fifteen minute chunk. In a lot of ways, I like this film: any time that I get to visit Twin Peaks with David Lynch as my guide, I'm happy. At the same time, I'm not really sure if this film needs to exist, as it doesn't reveal any new information, and it essentially spoils the whole story of the first two seasons. The only people who can really appreciate this movie for what it is are those who have seen the show, and those people already know everything that's going to happen in this movie, they just haven't seen it from Laura's perspective.
One of the truly great, original TV dramas, Twin Peaks was far from perfect; however, quite a few of its run of 29 episodes undoubtedly were. Speaking just after watching the finale, I'm torn between satisfaction at a superb final episode, and tenterhooks over what is a stark cliffhanger ending. The initial Laura Palmer murder case is unravelled expertly, by episode 16, with many great surreal and shocking moments, notably the scenes involving Bob. The show's brand of off-the-wall deadpan humour was perhaps at its best in the initial episodes, for example, Cooper's rock-throwing in the woods and Leland's bizarre, impromptu dance with Ben and Jerry Horne. The main characters were all well introduced; Kyle MacLachlan is on career-best acting form here as Agent Dale Cooper. Jack Nance is lovably gruff and likeable as Pete Martel, while Ben and Jerry Horne are wonderfully brought to life by fine writing, and acting from Richard Beymer and David Patrick Kelly. The strange spirit-like characters are introduced aptly; the Giant, the backwards-dancing Dwarf, One-armed Man, the bizarre Tremonds and killer Bob. Ray Wise deserves much credit for a sensitive portrayal of Leland. Once the initial mystery is more than adequately resolved, the focus was lost for a while. For around 7 episodes, the series comparatively treaded water: the comedy became more laboured and conventional, some tedious storylines dragged on and on - eg. Evelyn Marsh, Andy/Dick; the guiding hand of David Lynch was missing. These episodes are still very watchable; as other aspects of the mystery are mused over, but things move slowly. There is welcome characterisation of Major Briggs, but the acting and writing is at times more ordinary. While still a comfortably above-par TV show, the sublime atmosphere had been squandered to an extent. The arrival in the town of Windom Earle and, later, Annie Blackburn saw the stakes rise once more. Windom Earle is a truly sadistic, convincingly evil character, with a dry wit, wild expression and an effective penchant for disguise. His contribution to the series is immense, as a new focus is provided; climaxing with the stunning end to the penultimate episode at the Miss Twin Peaks Contest. Annie Blackburn also helps to enliven the programme, proving a subtle and effective character. Gordon Cole, played by David Lynch himself is a wonderful creation, up with Pete Martel, Albert Rosenfeld and Jerry Horne in the comic mould. I love that whole episode (c.25) where he enjoys life in the cafe, contemplating writing an "epic poem" about the wonderful apple pie and kissing Shelly in front of her boyfriend Bobby; "what you are witnessing is an intimate moment between two consenting adult human beings!" or somesuch quote.Ben Horne is well developed; the Civil War stuff fails to amuse quite as it should, yet once he is rehabilitated, the change in his character is refreshing and nicely handled. Twin Peaks is a beautiful series aesthetically, from the wonderful titles sequence, Angelo Badalamenti's stunningly evocative music scores to some wonderfully innovative photography and direction - usually in those episodes helmed by Lynch. Got to say the female quota of Twin Peaks is ample, with the beauty of Madchen Amick, Sheryl Lee, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially Sherilyn Fenn, adding poignancy. General negative comments seem irrelevant considering the overall quality of the series, but it's true tricks were missed. With the characters they had, some more imaginative situations and wit wouldn't have gone amiss. The comic possibilities of having Jerry Horne and, say, Gordon Cole interacting were unfulfilled. Some of the characters were bland - the spotless Norma Jennings, James Hurley, Audrey's boyfriend in the later episodes - and some failed to really work - Nadine I feel added little to the series.The very final episode is, I would say, as good a series ending as they could have come up with; tantalisingly placed, as the battle between the good and evil forces in Twin Peaks is hotting up. I declare that there are some brilliant images and directorial touches in that final one. There were however loose ends untied; what happened to Leo, Audrey and especially Ben Horne and Doc Hayward? A moot point is the absurdity of its ill-availabilty on video; I wouldn't have caught it if it weren't for the Sci-Fi Channel UK. Got to say though, that while harbouring some fantastical elements, Twin Peaks is assuredly far from the realm of Sci-Fi. It is, to be pointless categorical, like a surreal soap opera with a strong flavour of its own. There are so many great scenes, moments, lines and nuances, coupled with a magnificently dreamy, tenderly moving atmosphere when at its best, that I must say Twin Peaks ranks pretty much up there with the finest TV dramas of all - Edge of Darkness & The Singing Detective. Majestic it is. Rating:- ***** (out of *****)
Stunning and explosive, completely misunderstood by many when it ran from 1990-1991 and definitely trail-blazing for the art of television production, "Twin Peaks" is one of those could-have-been, should-have-been television series that ended up being remarkable anyway. A teenage girl (Sheryl Lee) is murdered. A strange police detective (Kyle MacLachlan) is brought in to solve the mystery as the local police just cannot cope with the crime. Strange situations continue to pop up all over the landscape of the titled Pacific Northwestern town though and it becomes sadly apparent that the crime will likely never be solved. Side-stories galore confuse and intrigue and the viewer is left wondering, "Does this have anything to do with the initial crime?". Then just when you think the puzzle is about solved, total chaos strikes with whacked dream sequences that make you question your own sanity. What is really happening in the town and do we really want to know or are we happier letting the mystery suck us in? "Twin Peaks" was created by David Lynch (arguably the finest American film-maker, along with Martin Scorsese, living today) and over two very abbreviated seasons (only 29 total episodes) television reached an age that may never be experienced again. At the time many (perhaps myself included) did not know what to make of the show and even more panned it completely. The fact that the series did not really end the way it should have is sad, but in another way it just adds to the legends and myths involved here. There were eight writers on this series and a mind-blowing 15 different directors (Lynch did some of the work and even Diane Keaton got an opportunity to add to the program). Performers like Ray Wise, Piper Laurie, Joan Chen, Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Russ Tamblyn and Madchen Amick appear, disappear and re-appear so frequently that you become confused as to what their roles in the show truly are. Monumental, gigantic, legendary, interesting, dominant and definitely thought-provoking, "Twin Peaks" is one of those television shows that amazes and dazzles with its highly unique brand of commentary. Followed by a theatrical movie ("Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me") in 1992 that was made to answer the questions presented throughout the program, it was also sadly misunderstood by most in the viewing public (even being rubbished by some who loved the series). A real gem in the history of television art. 5 stars out of 5.
Possibly one of the best TV dramas ever, "Twin Peaks" managed to be a challenging and unique (not to mention intelligent) piece of television.Daring and provocative, it shattered the boundaries of most standard soap operas/TV dramas.Terrified of it by a child (and in particular by BOB) I have since returned to it on DVD, only to find myself just as terrified and intrigued by it as I was when I was twelve years old and crouching behind my late grandmother's couch.A piece of groundbreaking television history... WATCH IT
Nowadays it is commonly accepted that American television is becoming better than movies, with edgier stories and more complex characters, both in mainstream (CSI, 24, Lost) and cable shows (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood). Twenty years ago, on the other hand, such a thing was unthinkable, at least until Twin Peaks aired.Created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, the series takes its name from a small American town where a grisly murder has been committed. The victim is local beauty Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a girl who seemed to have a perfectly normal life, only it turns out that's not the case: she had a lot of secrets, and in one of them lies the key to finding her killer. That assignment is given to Special FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Lynch regular Kyle MacLachlan), who quickly earns the trust and friendship of Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean) and the rest of Twin Peaks'inhabitants thanks to his extraordinary deductive methods and fascination for the calm and peace around him. And he is going to need all the help he can get, as Laura's murder is just one of the many odd things causing trouble in the heavenly surroundings: there's Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) and his dangerous connection with a casino/brothel known as One-Eyed Jack's; there's his daughter Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn), whose interest in Agent Cooper might put her in a worse situation than she thinks; there's the dispute over the Packard sawmill between Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) and Josie Packard (Joan Chen); and there are the bizarre creatures who populate Cooper's dreams, people like The Man From Another Place (a backwards-talking dwarf, played by Michael J. Anderson) or the terrifying Bob (Frank Silva), suggesting that most of the events in Twin Peaks may not have a rational explanation.Back in 1990, a series like this had never been done before, so its success was a little unexpected (sadly, ratings dropped during the second season, leading to the show's premature cancellation). Now it can be seen as an anticipation of that great TV creation that is HBO: the dead interacting with the living (Six Feet Under), ambiguous characters and even more ambiguous relationships between them (Deadwood), a consistent balance between moving and funny, beautiful and shocking (The Sopranos), the seeds of all those elements can be found in Twin Peaks, a show that didn't hesitate when it came to playing with the format or crossing the line in terms of mature content (death, drug abuse, rape) or on-screen violence (the ending of Episode 8, where one of the villains is shown at the peak of his abilities, is still one of the most audacious scenes ever shown on mainstream television). More than any other series, it represents the seamless merger of big and small screen, a fact that is underlined by Lynch's decision to further explore the story in a feature film after the last episode had aired. Fans of the visionary filmmaker will find plenty of his recurring themes, some a direct reference to his previous works (the ugliness lying underneath the apparent perfection, as seen in Blue Velvet), others a hint of things to come (the duality of Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, here embodied by Lee, who plays both the deceased Laura and her cousin).As always with the Eraserhead director, the acting is exceptional: MacLachlan and Lee are the standouts, the former playing his best role to date, a cunning combination of palpable vulnerability and impeccable wit, the latter shining with a double performance that should have been the beginning of a great career (alas, apart from a minor role in John Carpenter's Vampires, she hasn't done much since). The supporting cast (Ontkean, Laurie, Lara Flynn Boyle and Ray Wise in particular) adds depth and emotion, making some episodes the most affecting ever seen on a TV screen. As for the guest stars, not all of them are well known, but every single one brings something special to the series: the most notable cameos include a then unknown Heather Graham, a pre-X-Files David Duchovny (a quite funny and ironic contrast to Fox Mulder) and Lynch himself as a half-deaf FBI Regional Chief (one of the show's best characters).Those interested in American TV simply have to give Twin Peaks a look: it might be too weird or unsettling for some (but then again, that's always the case with Lynch's work), but it remains a landmark in contemporary television, and played a vital role in making the US small screen what it is today.
I watched the entire Twin Peaks series (the pilot and 28 episodes) over a period of 4 days this week, imagine my state of mind. I hadn't seen it since the original broadcasts in 1990-91. I have thought of it often over the years and seeing it now has reaffirmed my initial response of almost 20 years ago; hypnotic fascination during Season One, hopeful interest at the beginning of Season Two, glassy-eyed boredom in the middle episodes of same, and, at the end, frustrated excitement and even anger that we have been deprived of the continuation of the series into at least a third season. The first season of Twin Peaks is generally regarded as splendid, a magical, disturbing and moving recreation of a small community of us flawed and beautiful humans. The second season starts well but then chugs and splutters, the tires go flat in the middle episodes only to be pumped up and set back on the road going full-tilt only to crash into the wall of oblivion, not to be renewed for a third season. It is amazing to me how obviously Lynch and his team dropped the ball after Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed. Once that was done the writers launch into the most sophomoric and tedious bilge about Ben Horne going cuckoo and reliving the Civil War in his office at The Great Northern Hotel, high school pep-rally stuff, and it killed the show dead. This sorry sub-plot was coupled with another one about the most uninteresting character in the series, pouty James Hurley and his Harley. I was tired of his James Dean imitation after episode one, but to be pummeled by two episodes about him and some rich bitch trying to frame him for murder is too much. The poor guy is too stupid for words, as Laura Palmer noted early on in her diary. These 4 middle episodes are pointless and hideously boring and were, I have no doubt, responsible for the loss of a substantial number of the loyal audience at the time. To add insult to injury we are also subjected to a new guest star in the form of the worst actor known to man, Billy Zane. This over-exposed, fatuous vanity-victim is brought in to relieve Audrey Horne of her virginity, then flies off in his private jet, piloted by his perfect self, to fight the ecology war in Brazil or something (burning tons of jet fuel in the process no doubt.) I was bored stiff by these three interminable, adolescent and totally non-Lynch-like sub-plots.Things revive markedly as the writers got their heads together and made the wicked genius Windom Earl the centerpiece of the end of the season. We get to The Dark Lodge in the end. But this was truly The End as the show was canceled. I wanted to see The White Lodge where love triumphs over evil, as it is we are left with evil rampaging through Twin Peaks for eternity. I find that sad.We'll never know how Agent Cooper deals with Bob residing in his head, or if Norma and Big Ed get married or if Ben was conked dead or just cuckoo (again) by Dr Hayward, or whether Audrey and Pete Martell were blown to jell-o in the bank vault or whether Leo's teeth hold out keeping the tarantulas at bay until Sheriff Truman and Andy come to his rescue and take him to the Home. Why did David Lynch allow his 3/4 brilliant creation to dribble away like it did? Where was his commitment? I love his work but I will not forget how he left me in the lurch with the unfinished Twin Peaks, the short-lived prodigy of television, gone down in undeserved television ignominy.What might have been if the commitment had been as strong as the initial vision. You're better'n that Dave. Dammit.
Angelo Badalamenti's sweet theme begins as smokestacks billow, and a robin assures the viewer of the presence of love in a little town located through the pines, just this side of sanity...or reality. Either way you choose to look at it (and the choice is yours), every episode of this groundbreaking television show grabbed the viewer in its seductive and destructive web... and wouldn't let go. "Twin Peaks" began a string of weird television shows in the early 90's, but, unlike those later shows, "Twin Peaks" would be beloved and remembered long after it was off the air. "Twin Peaks" has earned a spot next to "The Twilight Zone", "Night Gallery", and "Star Trek" in terms of pioneering television and in terms of a cult following deserving of conventions and fanzines. I believe that F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper is one of the most enjoyable and inspiring characters in television history. His simple passions and quirky behavior was a welcomed sight in our living rooms every week during the shows very short run in the late 80's and early 90's. "Twin Peaks" started out on fire, gaining exposure during the pilot's multiple airings. The mystery of Laura Palmer's murderer practically invented conversations at the water cooler. However, the shows second season was scheduled to air on Saturday nights at 10:00, an advertiser's no-man's land. And, with the shows fan base out on the late weekend nights, the shows network decided to cancel it. David Lynch, the shows co-creator, directed a theatrically released film prequel to "Twin Peaks", showing all who missed the shows airings what really happened to Laura the week of her death, and, finally, her killer. As a huge fan of "Twin Peaks", I will tell you that the circle of events that occur within the story enable the viewer to relive the events over and over, each time around with more intensity than before. When you view the movie prequel, diving right back into the series becomes the natural path, allowing one to see things again for what they really are... or aren't. I highly recommend owning the entire series. Without a network messing up your viewing time, you can see the mystery unfold at your own pace. Viewing "Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me", along with the television pilot and the entire 29 episode series (about 33 hours all together), is the most fascinating and satisfying viewing experience that the entertainment industry has offered me so far. The music, costumes, editing, acting, and direction all received Emmy nominations, leading one to conclude that "Twin Peaks" not only satisfied the public, but the critics as well. An incredible achievement, "Twin Peaks" is my all-time favorite television show.
"Twin Peaks" is not a show for everybody. This isn't really a criticism...more an indication that the style of the program and the plot is something that the average viewer won't like or appreciate...but many others will. This is because the show is ultra-bizarre and often surreal--with strange dreams, visions, plots that go off the deep end with oddness and more. Believe me...it's among the strangest TV shows ever made...like the later episodes of "The Prisoner"...but weirder. What did I like about it? Well, the show's music was amazingly evocative and cool...really cool. The direction was often exquisite...well crafted and distinctive. I really appreciated it from the onset. Acting was generally good, though the show had a million and one subplots apart from the murder of Laura Palmer...and a few of the characters and their stories were both unnecessary and boring (such as Bobby Briggs). All in all, a highly uneven show (later ones got a bit too weird at times) but one of the most creative ever made. Worth seeing if you have a high threshold for the ultra-odd.
Twin Peaks, much like David Lynch's own Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet, among other great works of his, examines the main notion, idea and scope behind what it is meant to conventionally be. Twin Peaks is a murder-mystery show, yes, but this is not even scratching the surface as an identifying measure to say what the show is. Another explanation, as if it were possible, is that it is ABOUT mystery, and in the case of murder of life. That might seem a little too preachy or didactic, but as one goes deeper into the series, and deeper into the Black Lodge, and deeper into every single backwards-ass character on the show, a pattern emerges. Abstractions are Lynch's life blood, and even in the weirdest moments of the show he and Mark Frost, along with their writers and directors, make Twin Peaks a collection of abstractions, but at the same time making them as much as possibly within reach of human emotion. It's one of the rare times that the kind of artful penetration into what is essentially good, essentially evil, and even essentially gray-in-area in human beings that usually presides in cinema is let out, practically in each episode, like some kind of feverish worm that crawls in your mind and won't stop...Maybe it's the owls.But aside from the many, many, many layers to the show, to the dynamics between FBI Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLaughlin in his most recognizable role) and those he relates to everyday as well as in his dreams and Tibetan-inspired visions (the classic being the quintessential dream with the garbled-talking little-person), the teenagers with their own plots of neuroses and dramas and higher ambitions and darker demons, as well as those you'd least expect- the quiet ones- not to mention the ones residing on top in the little crevices we dare not usually seek out in small towns (i.e. the prostitution ring fronted by Mr. Horne), it's just a damn-well entertaining program. It's a superlative crossbreeding of the kind of inimitable melodrama that has the immediate feel of a soap-opera, but far more intelligent in the scope of acting and writing, and the classic absurdities that come up in the best of Lynch's work. Meaning that it will work, more or less, for two different audiences.Fans of Lynch's will drink it up like damn-good coffee the endless quirks that become commonplace, where characters in any other show would get little no-note roles like the secretary Lucy, or the psychologist Jacobi, or even a classic nut-bar like the Log-Lady, who has the claim that the log is really her dead husband. This, plus enough dream sequences, elaborate lighting and set-design schemes, and the outrageous characterizations make it vintage Lynch/Frost work. For the other crowd, those who don't usually watch Lynch's movies and are more of just the regular TV potatoes, the series has an appeal for its more genuine side, the one that stays true to the ideas and dramatic tensions behind the characters. Even when it gets too weird, and especially in season 2 the feeling starts to get stronger and more nagging, one can't really totally pull away from it, like as if some old man with an old storybook was reading out something almost certifiable, but intriguing all the same. Laura Palmer's death brings out what her life was all about, and really what anyone connected to her is all about; there's an appeal to find out what's behind the lives of others, especially when it balances out between light and dark tendencies.On top of this, the acting is par for the course top-notch. MacLaughlin, it seems could play this guy in his sleep after a while, and it doesn't take too long in the first season to get past his own odd-sense of awareness (and his regular reliance on dreams and visions) to get closer to solving the dreaded case of Laura Palmer. It's hard for me to think of any one performance that would be a bad one to knock-off, as even the more ludicrous ones- based on their characters- are played as believable as possible. Memorable guest appearances, however, are attributed to the likes of Michael Parks (known from the Tarantino/Rodriguez movies), David Duchovny (an excellent, far cry from Mulder) Frank Silva (as the one who, well, I won't say too much about him), and Lynch himself as the FBI regional chief who's a little hard of hearing. So much can be seen as the blackest of comedy, by turns very sudden and otherworldly and just plain strange (a signing and dancing Mr. Palmer and rows and rows of donuts just bits of what's in store), and it is often very funny. But there's also much in the way of what makes for the best TV: you want to keep watching each week, or now as is the case back to back on DVD, to see how this will turn out, however f***ed up it might get. Simply, it has something, if only in parts, for everybody/So get yourself some pie and coffee, make sure to speak backwards and forwards again, and don't underestimate the power of a giant with some clues on hand. Twin Peaks is a world of secrets unveiled, and secrets that maybe shouldn't be unveiled yet sought after, and there's enough to keep fans talking for years to come as one of the great 'cult' show in modern TV.
I have to admit when I first watched the pilot episode of Twin Peaks a couple of years ago, I wasn't sure what to think.  I knew about David Lynch, having recently seen Blue Velvet, and I knew he was a director that was on the outlandish side.  I borrowed the rest of the series from a friend, and after I watched the first 3 or 4 episodes, I was still scratching my head. I thought the murder premise was well done but I kept asking myself "why are these characters so strange?"However, as I got more into the series, I found myself obsessively hooked. The series, in it's own ominous way, was extremely funny and there were so many great one liners ("that's a damn good cup of coffee") and the characters kept you second guessing.  Though some characters were obviously villains, others had intentions that were often indistinguishable.As I relentlessly watched the show over a three week period, I found myself laughing out loud and being disturbed at the same time.  Ben Horne's meltdown is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in any TV series, I chuckle just thinking about it.  Only David Lynch could think of something that was so eccentric and funny at the same time.So in the end, I must say I found this show endlessly amusing.  Almost every person on the show has their own idiosyncrasy, appearances by future stars like Heather Graham and David Duchovny injected humor and depth into the show, and heck, there was a sheriff named Harry S Truman, what else do you need?I am glad to see the first season is on DVD, I can't wait until the rest is released.  I wish this show had been on much longer but it is such a bizarre show that I can understand why mainstream America did not understand it. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone that likes TV shows which are light-hearted or straightforward.  Be warned, the final episode is completely bizarre, and not necessarily funny.As a whole, the show has a very alien feel to it and may chase many people away, but if you understand David Lynch's warped sense of humor and can see the sheer lunacy of the show, you will find it endlessly entertaining.
I have purchased recently in DVD the complete series. I felt it was a duty to watch such a famous show. I was not disappointed. The show has a great quality, and it is weirdness and original sense of humor are just great. However, the show should have ended when the killer of Laura Palmer is found and discovered. The whole second season is actually very bad. There is an abuse of stupid humor and stupid sub-plots in the second season: 1. It is abusive to show us so much the idiotic problems of Lucy Moran and the dim-witted deputy Andy, and the addition of the clothes salesman is not much better. 2. Windom Earle is not at all a good character. It is much of a buffoon, and it is just ridiculous to show him always disguised in fancy dress in a small village. All population in Twin Peaks must be not very clever, because in just 24 hours, a guy like Windom Earle in such a small place as Twin Peaks would have been spotted and discovered very easily. It is just pure buffoonery.in 24 hours everybody would greet Windom: hey, Windon, good morning, again in fancy dress??What a bad ass you are, man¡¡¡ 3. James Hurley is a terrible character. The guy makes no sense at all and it is almost revolting to listen to his utterly idiotic and brainless dialogs. By far the worst character in Twin Peaks. What a disgusting stereotype¡¡¡ 4. The Japanese businessman stunt makes no sense whatsoever, and it is a very poor conception. 5. The reappearance of Andrew, and the fact that Josie ends up as a maid are also ridiculous and inconceivable. 6. The madness of Ben Horne trying to recreate again the American Civil war is just awful. I just couldn't watch it and had to use the remote control of the DVD to go to the next scene. 7. The affair of Audrey Horne with the rich guy in the private jet before flying to Brazil is also grotesque.And the highly praised end of the series, the final episode, is actually not as good as many say. It is so obvious that they ran out of ideas that the only option possible was to give a shocking and dark end just to make you think and leave the viewer with a sour feeling. However, it is not good enough, and it is not up to the high standards of the first part of the series. I also must say that I was quite disappointed at the sci-fi and paranormal stuff. The character of Bob, that evil spirit that takes over their hosts and commits murders is quite ridiculous. I find pitiful the constant use of a mirror in which we see the "diabolic face" of Bob laughing like a madman. That is not scary. That is just grotesque. Even Low budget horror movies have far more acceptable approaches and far more interesting characters. To know that Laura Palmer was actually killed by an evil spirit who is always behaving like a jester, buffoon or joker and laughing in mirrors (maybe scary for children, because it makes me laugh) is really very bad. We deserved another killer. We deserved a really scary killer, and not just a grotesque and playful demon who lacks ability to scare and convey fear. Bob is ridiculous. Bob lacks a convincing evil background, a personality, and a history. Bob is a very weak stunt, and a very poor attempt at trying to convey "something too scary to be fully explained". Bad. This being said, I would daresay that the series are too overrated. It is good television, it is a good show, and some parts of the first season have an outstanding quality. Indeed very good television and art in its purest form. However, they did not manage to develop properly the wonderful ideas they had, and the show lost quality at full speed.
This is one of the shows that I started watching because many people, whose opinions I valued, stated, repeatedly, that I "absolutely must see this." Let me say that I was pretty much hooked from the first scene when they discover the body. The one deputy crying at the body was both touching and kind of funny. It perfectly introduced the entire series which is serious and ridiculous all at once. There is so much to talk about this incredible series which burned too bright to burn for very long.For starters, Agent Cooper is the single greatest character ever captured on film (go ahead, try and think of a better one). He's brilliant, genuinely caring, incredibly funny, exuberant to the nth degree, unbelievably likable, but also with a sordid past which haunts him. Nobody, but nobody, could have delivered the pie and coffee compliments with so much gusto. However, he is just the brightest star in the sky. There are so many crazy, yet somehow believable characters that grace Lynch's universe. The swift descent of Ben Horn into madness is sad, pathetic, surreal and hilarious. No other series would have dared contain a man believing that he was General Lee commanding the south at Gettysburg (it also provides the funniest line from the show, when Audrey Horn is talking to his psychiatrist and he remarks that "What he (Ben Horn) needs now is our sympathy, understanding and a confederate victory."). All of the characters create a amazing tapestry where one is genuinely anticipating which character is going to lose it somehow (but one never anticipates correctly). In this reviewers opinion, the plot takes a backseat to the characters which are too strange, or too ordinary but never dull, to exist in any other show anywhere (minus James, who gets irritating right when he starts singing and never stops). Fantastic actors all around with more career launching cameos than any show or movie ever.Sadly, the second season is not as good as the first, plot-wise, but still is as quirky and entertaining with an unbelievable ending to the series. Many have criticized the show for being excessively intellectual, but I never found the show pedantic or hopelessly cryptic. Rather, it seemed as though David Lynch just decided to employ every weird idea that popped into his febrile mind for the sheer joy of it. To finish, one needs to watch this show. It's not uniformly brilliant and sometimes just plain weird, but always rewarding and truly one of the landmarks of American television. Go get a nice piece of cherry pie, a cup of coffee, take four days off work and start watching it.
The opening credits and music grabbed me right away. That sad, cool, reflective music. The log being cut in the mill. The bird.This is a show that you know, as you are watching it, that it is special and destined to become a classic. What a wonderful memory. One of my favorite moments in the first episode is Andy crying, and later telling the girl not to tell the sheriff. It really brought humanity to Laura's death.Can't wait to one day own the whole series on DVD, and one summer night, start watching the episodes one by one.Another amazing aspect of the opening episode is the many types of characters and settings involved, just within the town of Twin Peaks. The school, the lodge, the sheriff office, the lake, the railroad tracks. It was almost as if several shows and genres were evident in one episode. Something for everyone. But it still tied together so amazingly.
After hearing nothing but great things about Twin Peaks(although there were criticisms of the second season not being as good and some being underwhelmed by the ending) I finally checked out the show and the film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me as somebody who appreciates David Lynch hugely and love almost all his films, and it was time well worth spent. It's true that the first season is better than the second, but that is not to knock the second season because it is still great, if not as well paced and maybe the main plot line was wrapped up a little too quickly(the only negative personally against the series), but the first season is a masterpiece and some of the best television has ever seen. There have been criticisms about the reveal of the final episode being underwhelming, initially it is a head-scratcher but I am with those who considers the episode on the whole one of the scariest episodes seen on television.Twin Peaks looks incredible, quite easily one of the best-looking TV series personally watched; the photography is so good that you have to check that it's for a television show and not a film and the costumes and sets are colourfully surreal and positively eye catching. Twin Peaks is also one of the best scored television series, the music enhances the atmosphere so well and better than a lot of other shows and it really haunts the mind, again like the visuals it can easily be mistaken for a score written for a film. The dialogue is very thought-provoking with moments of tension and a lot of hilarious humour that has David Lynch's style of humour all over it. The episodes are all compelling and multi-faceted in atmosphere, even the weakest episodes are much better than a lot of TV shows today at their best and worst, while the show tackles a very dark subject with subtle horror, genuinely disturbing scenes like the entire ending, quirky humour that at its best is side-splittingly hilarious and a real emotional wallop.The characters are not only interesting with more than one dimension to them but more than memorable as well, Agent Cooper and Ben Horne being especially so, sure a few appear, disappear and re-appear but you never forget them. Twin Peaks is superbly directed and acted throughout, with the performances Kyle MacLachlan in his most famous role(perhaps) is at his best and the same can be said for Richard Beymer. Sheryl Lee and Sherilyn Fenn are poignant, Ray Wise is much more sensitive than he is in the film and one mustn't forget the scene-stealer that is Piper Laurie nor Frank Silva as one of the most frightening characters television has ever seen. Strictly speaking the acting is outstanding all round, you'd be hard pressed to find a television series with no actor is bad and with this level of consistency. To conclude, at its best Twin Peaks really is one of the greatest television series ever. The film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is not as good but is still very good and undeservedly under-appreciated. 10/10 Bethany Cox
This is definitely one of the best things David Lynch has ever done.  What attracted me to this series was it's quirkyness and surreal nature.  If there was ever a TV series that identified the 90's, this is one of them.Personally, I think they should've stopped the series right after they solved Laura Palmer's murder, but oh well.  I hope they someday make another movie to tie up some of the loose ends such as the way the series ended on a cliffhanger.Anyways, onto my lunch of a baguette with butter and brie and some cherry pie.
Warning: *Some spoilers are discussed*."Twin Peaks", is a surreal thriller, serialized for the TV, by acclaimed writer and director David Lynch. The show is seemingly about the murder of teenager Laura Palmer, but eventually it becomes apparent that it's about good and evil and the duality of everyone, wrapped in a paranormal way. In many ways, "Twin Peaks" is a lot like "Lost": people who are not what they seem but are interconnected, deep mysteries, and paranormal elements that drive their fans into theory frenzy! "Twin Peaks" did it first: it put people into theory mode, it's just that unfortunately for it, the Internet was not widespread at the time, and so much of the glory was lost in localized conversations (aka the "watercooler show") rather than becoming an international phenomenon.The first season was almost perfect. It was up to the point, interesting, haunting. I regard the second season being split into two phases: the Laura Palmer investigation, which is a continuation of the first season, and the aftermath after the killer is found. The first phase of the second season is not too bad, but it's apparent that things started to get a bit haywire with the writers, David Lynch having very little involvement with the show, and ABC trying to drive the project. For example, the Harold Smith outdoors-phobic and Japanese investor subplots where useless and silly. But you haven't seen silly yet.In the second phase, 90% of the plot is downright silly. From the pregnant Lucy and her two silly men, to James and rich lady subplot which had nothing to do with anything else, to James in general being portrayed like a man whore having the hots of four women in 15 days time while at the same time he's supposed to be level-headed (remember, 1 episode is 1 day in the "Twin Peaks" world), to Josie becoming a maid (what the hell?), to Ben Horne becoming crazy and then sane again, to Leo getting controlled by a dog collar (!), to Nadine and mayor's stupid subplots, to David Duchovny guest-starring and appearing in woman's dresses. I mean, the consensus is that "Twin Peaks" lost its audience because the killer was revealed, but the truth is, it's lost its audience because the show lost the plot entirely, all by itself. I could barely sit through and watch the second season's second phase. I would pause it every 10 minutes and go eat something, or check out my email. I just couldn't sit through an entire episode anymore (except the last two where Lynch came back to direct).The truth is this: "Twin Peaks" should not have had more than 16 episodes. It should have ended when the murderer is revealed, and should have replaced some unneeded subplots with some of the (rare) points found in the second phase, like the Lodges, Cooper getting possessed by BOB after Laura's murderer dies, the army's involvement & Major Biggs etc. And after the series' run, the three movies should have been created, just like Lynch wanted it. Only one movie was shot at the end, because by that time, the peaksmania had died down, exactly because of that disastrous second phase, and so the movie didn't do well in the box office. Maybe these movies should have been tele-movies.In conclusion, "Twin Peaks" failed because no one could take the step "Lost" writers took with ABC in February 2007: to give an end to the series and not let it go on and on forever like that. If Lynch was to strike such a deal with ABC before he started shooting, then "Twin Peaks" could have become the ultimate series today (both TV and cinema). It's a shame really.
This overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. I am not quite sure what they mean by "ground-breaking" and "original" when they fawn all over Lynch and his silly little TV opus. What exactly is their criteria of what is original? Sure, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" it's original. Definitely. Next to "Law & Order" TP spews originality left and right.Fans of TP often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough, open enough for the show's supposed "weirdness", its alleged wild ingenuity, or whatever. As a fan of weirdness myself, I have to correct that misconception. There is nothing too off-the-wall about TP; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but (or because of it) ultimately going nowhere. The supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time. There's a difference...Whenever I watch the "weird dream" sequence in "Living In Oblivion" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let's-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene cliché, I think of Lynch. You want weird? "Eraserhead" is weird - in fact, it's beyond weird, it's basically abstract. You want a unique TV show? Watch "The Prisoner". You want a strange-looking cast? Felini's and Leone's films offer that. TP looks like an overly coiffed TV crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. The cast gives TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies en masse.In fact, one of the producers of TP said that Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle's? Sheryll Fenn's? Like those effeminate-faced "hunks" straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Don't get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (the way Madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier), but then don't go around saying you're making a "weird show with weird-looking people". And I have never understood Lynch's misguided fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right). He is not unlikable, but lacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. His character's laughable "eccentricities" were not at all interesting, merely one of Lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to his reputation - him having completely lost his edge by that time. Everything Lynch made post-"Elephant Man" was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies. What followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on Lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put-together stories that don't hold any water on closer scrutiny. In other words, Lynch is every intellectual-wannabe's darling. So Laura Palmer was killed by her Dad...? He was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense. That's the best this "great mind" could come up with... You've got B-movie horror films that end with more originality. Lynch is neither bright nor hard-working enough to come up with a terrific story. What he does have though is his "artist aura", which has turned him into somewhat of a cinema god for people who are easily duped.
First of all, let me state that I am viewing the show from the lens of 2017, which is a fantastic era for television. For the last 20 years we have seen dozens of "top shelf" dramas, many which probably were inspired (to some degree) by the original Twin Peaks. I have no doubt Twin Peaks was an important show and helped build the foundation of TV greatness today. At the time, I have no doubt that it was light-years ahead of the garbage that was airing on the major networks (and honestly still is ahead of most of the major network programming, although that isn't saying much).Now on the my review, which reflects season 1 and season 2 of the original Twin Peaks show. If you are tuning in for the first time to these shows like me (I was in college when the shows originally aired and I did not watch them), then I would advise you to skip them. If you want to watch the "new" version of the show, I would recommend just going to Youtube and finding a nice summary of the original series. Because I promise that watching 30 hours of the original series is NOT time well spent, at least for my wife and I.My expectations were not real high as I knew that the show would be dated. I knew it would be quirky. I knew that the director has some real oddball stuff, and that of course is part of the appeal. But the show is just bad. The acting in some cases is so bad that I was not sure if it was supposed to look like bad acting, or if it was just bad acting. The story line started off good, and honestly season 1 is tolerable and had some fun moments. And then season 2 kicks it up to a ridiculous notch and never gets grounded for the run of the series. What started off as a murder mystery turns into a complete mess that reminds me of something Stephen King would have written during his drug-altered years (Dreamcatcher anyway? Yeah, that kind of bad). I love David Lynch, I love Kyle MacLachlan, and I love Stephen King for that matter. But this show is just a steaming pile of crazy bad television. Incredibly unsatisfying to say the least.So I know I will get lots of non-helpful votes, and I'm fine with that. If you love the show, good for you, but ask yourself if you love the originality that the show brought in 1990, or if you really think this is great television in 2017. I'm sure a 1990 Corvette scored high marks by the auto magazines in 1990, but a 1990 Corvette evaluated by 2017 car magazines would slam it for being a slow piece of junk that is unreliable, gets terrible gas mileage, is very uncomfortable, and is much slower than a 2017 Toyota Camry. Since we live in 2017, my review is written from a current perspective.Bottom line, if you have never seen the show, I advise you to skip it and instead jump into something like Fargo (a quirky screwball show but it is very well done and ultimately is satisfying to watch). Thanks for reading my review.
Spoilers herein.There are two characters here, the creative mind of Lynch and the market forces of TeeVee. Lynch has built a project around two such notions before: in `Blue Velvet' the two main characters were the small town movie and the twists of his mind. In Blue, the formula worked marvelously because the hierarchy worked: the base was the movie form and it was inherently enriching. Same with `Mulholland.'The risk here is much greater because the base is TeeVee, and that form is the opposite. It drains. In Blue, Lynch's mind could weave values with the `small town' movie. Here, it is relied upon to provide all the life. Instead of the partner enlivening, it drains. Compare this to `Fire Walk' to see what I mean.Here, the notion is to go as far as possible with nothing happening. All must be in stasis. The joke is that while much is revealed nothing is ever explained, and if nothing else, TeeVee audiences are addicted to clarity and simplicity. So as with Seinfeld, the TeeVee audience went along with the joke; `oh, I get it... there's nothing there.. there's not _supposed_ to be something there.'This must have been frustrating for Lynch. He surrounded himself with people he knew and trusted. Many had worked on his films. All agreed. No one deliberately fell away from the plan. But everyone did, because the medium is so powerful it bends the best intentions. It is impossible to work this kind of intelligence with TeeVee. This is a very strong lesson for those who study film and how it affects the society's methods of reasoning.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.
Created by David Lynch(director of "Eraserhead" and "The Elephant Man") and Mark Frost, "Twin peaks" combines drama, comedy and mystery with some elements of supernatural horror in a unconventional, impressive manner.The story follows the investigations the agent Dale Cooper to solve the mysterious murder of a beautiful and beloved girl, Laura Palmer, who is seemed as a role-model by almost everyone in the town of Twin peaks. However, things aren't what it seem in "Twin Peaks" and no one is who pretends to be. Many dark secrets of almost all the characters are revealed in every episode, but always in a fascinating, intriguing way. This show caught me since the first episode, until the surprising, disturbing and impressive last episode. This is one of the most artistic TV-shows ever made. All the characters are unique and the performances are great. The music made by Angelo Badalamenti, is great as the show, giving a unique feeling. Many shows tried (like "Lost") tried to be like this one. But for me at least, it never won't be any shows like this. This is a must-see for everyone.
"Twin Peaks" was a fantastic show that was quite experimental for its time (1990-1991) that at it's worst was better than most everything else on TV. I wish the show could have survived longer, but with an awful second season time slot - Saturday at 10pm - it had no chance. The revelation of Laura Palmer's killer took the wind out of the sails somewhat just nine shows into the second season, but the true theme of Twin Peaks was about the evil in the woods that took the form of the killer and the seamy underbelly of what appeared to be everyday small-town life. The murder of Laura Palmer was just the surface of that. Three somewhat pointless episodes followed the one that revealed Laura's killer, but then the show bounced back with the Windham Earle storyline. Unfortunately many viewers had stopped watching the show by then. Perhaps the lasting legacy of "Twin Peaks" is that it made series with weird subplots, long story arcs, and oddball characters more acceptable to the networks. For example, I don't think that "The X-Files" could have made it to the air in 1993 had it not been for "Twin Peaks" preceding it and succeeding. After all, after a show where there is a dwarf that materializes on a bed, dances, and talks backwards, an alternate reality where clones are created and sent out to the world, and creamed corn as a symbol of suffering, the adventures of Scully and Mulder look as thematically tame as Dragnet. Highly recommended.
Twin Peaks started off with enormous popularity, and by the middle of the second season the show began to lose it's fans as it became stranger and stranger. And it is understandable why people stopped viewing. The main question when the show started was "Who killed Laura Palmer?", and after only 17 episodes, the question was answered and the show's plot switched. Characters were also being killed off left and right. This show's progression was too fast for it's own good, and that's what probably led to it's downfall...that and the second season which was a big let down compared to the first.Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) is one of the most beloved residents of the small town of Twin Peaks, so it comes as a huge shocker when she is found dead. Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle McLaughlan) is called in to town to help with the case, and the possible murderers are many. Also in the town of Twin Peaks, or in the outskirt forests, are many secrets, and supernatural happenings.Season one of Twin Peaks is great. It introduces the characters well, and is the perfect mixture of comedy and drama. This season only touched upon the supernaturals that the series would soon adapt, which may have been a complaint among fans, but season two went overboard. Season two is good, but was just too much. Laura Palmer's killer was revealed mid season, and really that was the end of the show's plot. It tried to be a smooth transition, but it wasn't. Before this point, Laura Palmer was the show's star, and when she was laid to rest along with her murderer (In one of the show's most brilliant episodes), the show lost something. It went off to become too bizarre it was bordering on silly. But still, even with this season, this was an excellent show.As for originality, this show is one of the most original shows ever thought up. It's basically a supernatural soap opera murder mystery that attracts both males and females, and has a huge cast, with each episode playing as an anthology of character observations. Season one was near perfect, season two was near great, and overall this was an excellent series.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 48 mins per episode. TV14
The series opens with the body of local beauty Laura Palma being discovered and one could be forgiven that this was going to be another routine murder mystery. There are the expected strange clues such as a letter hidden under the girls nails linking it to a previous crime... which might lead one to think it is a serial killer drama. The local sheriff's department call in the FBI and Agent Dale Cooper is dispatched to town; he is to become the series' protagonist. He starts out investigating the death as he would any other but it isn't long before things turn strange; he has a strange dream that is some how more than a dream and people see a strange man know as Bob. As the investigation continues we learn more about Laura's life and discover that she wasn't as innocent as people thought and was mixed up with some dangerous people; that doesn't mean it was one of them who killed her though. The series is about much more than a murder investigation; it also follows the lives of those affected by it and those around them. There are many subplots involving the personal relationships of the people and their general lives.This series deserves to be considered a cult classic; creator David Lynch does a great job bringing his strange world to the screen; nothing here is quite normal... even the things that appear to be are just slightly off; for example even though the film is set in the present (at the time it was made) it has a '50s feel to it; as though the town was somehow in the wrong time! The acting from the main cast was spot on; especially Kyle MacLachlan who plays Agent Cooper, Michael Ontkean who plays Sheriff Harry Truman and Sherilyn Fenn who played the sultry Audrey Horne, one of Laura's friends. It isn't the question of who killed Laura Palmer that makes the series so fascinating, that gets solved early in the second season; it is discovering little details about the characters as the series progresses and when it ends you will either be tearing your hair out in frustration or thinking you've just seen something great... or possibly both!
When Laura Palmer is murdered in the quiet town of Twin Peaks, the similarities to another murder brings the involvement of the FBI in the form of Agent Dale Cooper.  Cooper teams up with Sheriff Truman to help catch the killer.  However using Cooper's less than conventional methods they find a mysterious world of goings on in the small town leading as far as drugs, deceit and demons.David Lynch's television series falls somewhere between the themes of his films without the 18-rated content and a bit of a failure.  Since Lynch's films don't get multiplex audiences it's perhaps surprising that this series was so successful (apart from being cancelled of course!).  Lynch's look at oddities etc in normal life and his themes of things being wrong just behind the picket fences (see also Blue Velvet) come through well, as does his eye for quirky characters.  Each episode had a cliff hanger of sorts although sometimes the plot spun wildly out of control.  The actually twists in the identity of the killer and certainly the overall ending was maybe too much for mainstream America to deal with in a TV show but most of this is pure Lynch.The performances are all good and link with his quirky vision well.  Lynch favourite Kyle MacLachlan is good as Cooper while the rest of the cast are made up by TV actors on the whole who manage to hold a small town, TV drama feel to the whole thing that makes it feel that little bit more uncomfortable when the weirdness comes.  Small roles from the likes of Miguel Ferrer, Lynch etc add interest.Overall this is a long Lynch movie.  Demons, drugs, weird characters all in a normal picket fence community.  Very enjoyable if a little to much to last several series.  Depending on how you feel about it the ending is either a superb place to leave it as it shows the power of evil, or a huge let down. I liked it myself.
How does one begin to describe the series that is his absolute favorite and of which he firmly believes that it remains the most genius and unique piece of television heritage of all times? Perhaps with the obvious statement that every single episode is a mini- masterpiece; - a true feast for all senses that puts you in a kind of magical trance throughout its running time and even long after it's finished. I recently finished watching the series integrally for the third time. The first time was when it first aired on Belgian television in the early nineties. Since I was only 11-12 years old around then, many of the surreal aspects and expressionist trademarks were incomprehensible for me, and I also vividly remember that my parents strongly disapproved of me watching a show that dealt with prom queens being murdered and midgets talking backwards! And yet, even though I didn't capture perhaps half of what was going on, I principally remember that I was lured to the screen as soon as I heard the ominous tunes of Angelo Badalamenti's fantastic theme music and gazed at the show in sort of hypnotized state. The second time I watched the whole series was around 10 years ago when I insisted to introduce "Twin Peaks" to my then-girlfriend who never heard of it. She wasn't very enthusiast and gave up after only six or seven episodes of the first season. The relationship didn't last, not coincidentally I reckon, but I did complete the series on my own and became even more obsessed with the events and the many versatile and intriguing characters that live in the titular northwest lumber town. My third viewing naturally got inspired by the news of the new season – "Twin Peaks" is back after 25 years – and the hope that it'll quickly become available here in Europe as well. I'm not in the habit of writing user comments for TV- series, but I felt it was appropriate to make an exception for the greatest one ever made. "Twin Peaks" is the brain child of master filmmaker David Lynch, and anyone even remotely familiar with his repertoire ("Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet", "Lost Highway") knows that his imagination is unlimited as well as unpredictable, and that his style is inimitable as well as astounding. Even though "Twin Peaks" is far more accessible than the vast majority of Lynch's movies, overall weirdness and unworldly atmosphere remain primary factors in the pilot feature film and all 30 episodes. "Twin Peaks" is at its most brilliant when it's surreal, but the series is equally brilliant when the events are more rational. The basic premise is the search for the murderer of the 17-year-old local beauty Laura Palmer. When her body is discovered, wrapped in plastic nearby a lakeside shore, the sleepy and seemingly idyllic little lumber town is turned upside down and the darkest secrets of several eminent and less eminent town inhabitants gradually come to the surface. The local Sheriff's department, led by Harry S. Truman (that choice of name alone is awesome), receives the help of the slightly eccentric but mainly amiable and coffee-worshiping FBI agent Dale Cooper. How can the solving of only one simple murder case keep you glued to the TV- screen for one and a half seasons, whereas other detective/thriller series solve similar crimes in less than one hour almost every week? The short and simple answer would be that "Twin Peaks" is unlike every other show and every episode brings forward new surprises, unexpected revelations, enigmatic sub plots and dark new edges of familiar characters. The murdered Laura Palmer is a perfect of this herself. When her body is found, we – as well as most of the townsfolk – assume that she was regular teenage girl with normal interests and worries, but a few episodes later it becomes painfully clear that Laura was everything but a prototype teenager. This goes for practically every character and event in "Twin Peaks"; - nothing or nobody is what they seem, making this the most unconventional soap opera ever made. Even when the murder of Laura Palmer is resolved (allegedly the main reason why the viewing rates dropped significantly and the show got canceled), and the story primarily revolves on the cat-and-mouse game between Dale Cooper and his old nemesis Windom Earle, "Twin Peaks" continues to spawn creative and compelling inside stories. I could easily write a full-length review for each episode or an extended essay on every single supportive character of this show, but nobody like to read that much, right? I'll narrow it down to stating that every tiniest detail is worth discovering and every resident of Twin Peaks is worth getting acquainted with. There's a fantastic balance between nightmarish imagery and comical reliefs, there's the ideal mixture between surrealism and straightforward action/suspense and there's the underlying yet omnipresent ambiance of good versus evil. The episodes directed by David Lynch himself, six in total including the pilot film, are undoubtedly superior to the rest, but every director or cast member that worked on "Twin Peaks" truly surpassed him or herself. Same goes for the downright stellar ensemble cast. Most of these actors and actresses will be forever linked to their characters here, and they can be proud of it too! I'm in love with every woman that lives in Twin Peaks! Since age 11, I had a crush on Donna, Shelly, Audrey, Nora, Laura, Maddy, Josie, Annie, as well as a peculiar fondness for Nadine and the Log Lady. As for the men, well, I'd sure love to have a cup of coffee and a chat with the entire Sheriff's department, the Bookstore Boys, the Northern Hotel management and even the unreliable crooks. The show is more than 25 years old and still doesn't look the least bit dated. Can't wait to see the 2017 season!
Twin Peaks is definitely not for everyone. But for those willing to take a chance ..... Lynchian zaniness ensues. Twin Peaks(1990-1991) is a masterwork of avant-garde television cinema. It is equal parts weird, engrossing, horrifying, funny, heartwarming, and all around captivating! David Lynch is the master of his own style and this show is one for the ages.One of the greatest TV shows of all time. Once you start, you will get hooked.
I adore David Lynch. I have no idea why he did this film. Sometimes I think he is putting us on with these vignettes that the average person could say, "I bet I could do much better, given the opportunity." But we don't. This is one minute from the discovery of a murder victim to the telling of her family. OK. Now what?
"Premonition Following an Evil Deed" is an American 1-minute short film from 1995, but if you take a look at it, then you can also make a statement for this being a movie from 1895 because it is in black-and-white and, despite it being an English-language film according to IMDb, there is no spoken or written language in here. It is probably director David Lynch's tribute to the very early days of filmmaking and as such it is a fairly dark movie in terms of the subject. Nothing uncommon for Lynch. But I also do believe that without his name attached to the project, this would be a relatively forgotten film now over 2 decades later. It is also one of Lynch's least known (short) filmmaking efforts. There is just nothing really memorable to it other than the imitation aspect of what Méliès and others did a century earlier. Not a failure I guess, but also not worth seeing for anybody other than Lynch completionists. I give it a thumbs-down.
I dont know really what to think about these short . But for me its an exercise for David Lynch to try to tell abstract things by the images that s all.
Just watched this for the first time, and enjoyed it immensely. Some here have suggested that there's no 'real' story at all. I don't agree: Lynch doesn't work like that - no matter how bizarre and reticulated, there's a story there, all right, but you have to dig for it.'Mulholland Drive' informs this film considerably. Having deconstructed that one to my satisfaction, I have a clearer view of how Lynch does things; how he shows us the elements, the language he uses, and what he leaves out for us to discover. So, then - *SPOILERS*, if I'm right:As with MD, there's a big clue in the first few seconds: Fred is shown in close-up, looking thoroughly wrecked, smoking a cigarette unsteadily. There's a buzzing sound, and light sweeps across his face and the room. *The sound is one you'll become familiar with later, in the jailhouse.* Fred looks up, warily.Major premise: I believe this scene shows Fred, in the last moments of his life, having his last cigarette before they come to take him to the chair. This may, in fact, be the only 'real' scene in the film, with everything else being Fred's distorted recollection, and the rest a psychotic break fantasy he constructs to escape from his grim situation.As the door to his cell opens, Fred rejects the awfulness of reality, and transforms the buzz into the sound of his door intercom, and at this point we go into his personal flashback as the story continues.The acting and dialogue is often stilted and unrealistic in this flashback. What we're seeing is Fred's recollection, which - as he himself says - is not necessarily the way it actually happened. His relationship with Renee is tense and unreal, with lots of suppressed rage. Cleverly, the undercurrents are conveyed mostly by the background sounds - listed in the credits as 'Ominous drones' - and these provide the significance that the dialogue alone would lack.At the party scene several events take place: his suspicions about Renee and the impossibly sleazy - because he's seen through Fred's eyes - lounge-lizard Andy are effectively confirmed (for him). And he meets the 'Mystery Man', a devil-figure who tells Fred "You invited me (into your home). It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted". I suspect that this figure is Fred's attempt to unload his guilt onto someone else: a 'devil who made him do it' - don't you have to invite the devil into your house? Perhaps he's the personification of Fred's insanity, or his jealousy. Or all of the above - all the dark influences in Fred's life and head.As the flashback continues, we see the progression up to the point where he finally does murder Renee, horribly. Again he attempts to reject the reality by showing it all on video, but reality intrudes and a few seconds are shown of him 'really' sitting among the dismembered parts of his wife. His subsequent trial and sentencing are skipped over - they're a blur to Fred - and he winds up on Death Row.Facing execution, and unable to tolerate his real state, Fred then creates a fantasy in which he escapes his fate by miraculously turning into another person - an innocent: young, enjoying a simple life, good at his simple job; with groovy, understanding parents and a pliable girlfriend.The scenes around Fred's miraculous replacement are classic Lynch fantasy-made-real: the dialogue is ludicrous; the events comic-book. We see the same in the fantasy world of the central character in MD.Although safe in this new fantastical environment, Fred/Peter is unable to resist being drawn back into danger, initially via his unlikely relationship with the - again comic-book - gangster boss, Mr. Eddy. This gangster character is a one-dimensional, violent crazy man who recalls the fantasy mafia types invented by the central character in MD to 'explain' her bad break.Even so, Peter's life will remain peaceful if he avoids any dealings with Eddy outside of the grease-monkey relationship. But Fred's paranoia demands danger, and Peter begins an even less plausible and obviously perilous association with Fred's new incarnation of Renee: the pure-hearted damsel in distress that is Alice.Except that, once again, Peter's life is contorted by Fred's paranoia, and Alice slowly metamorphoses into a spiteful, greedy psychotic who leads Peter further into danger. (I looked for the 'Eye of the Duck' peripeteiac scene that Lynch always puts into his films, and one of the candidates is, I think, the moment where Alice points the gun at him after raiding 'Andy's' house. The tableau is held long enough to allow you to contemplate all that could happen if she shoots Peter and takes off. But that's not possible in a Fred/Peter fantasy, so we continue, with the point about her ruthlessness made.)What else? The storyline continues as might be expected, with Alice now in total control. The cabin we've seen before just prior to Fred's metamorphosis. Alice disappears. The Mystery Man returns, and so does Mr. Eddy and Fred. All of this in a fight, during which the devil-figure hands him a knife that allows him to defeat Eddy/Dick Laurent (as we have discovered), and finally everything turns to crap as Fred heads back onto the highway with retribution on his tail. Things look hopeless, and the escape fantasy has brought him back to the point where he came in.And then Fred begins another metamorphosis, which we never see completed, and the film ends. Is this another fantasy escape, or his death in the Chair? I don't know how much of this is correct. Perhaps one day someone will tie Mr. Lynch to a rack, put electrodes on his nuts, and extract the line-by-line details of his wonderful creations. Until then we must wonder and worry. And marvel.
This is the first film directed by David Lynch I've seen, not counting The Elephant Man, which is another great film, but is an outsider in his career, since it is not surreal. This film is, however, making it the first typical Lynch film I've seen. And I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. I had heard a lot about Lynch's films before watching, but I guess I hadn't heard enough. I went into this film hoping for a good mystery, an interesting puzzle to solve. As the end credits rolled I didn't know what to make of what I had just seen. I didn't get an answer to the question I kept asking while I was watching; "What exactly is this film about?". As soon as the credits were over, I read a comment or two by Lynch fans... and the truth dawned on me. It's not supposed to be solved. It's not a movie where you, when you see the very end, exclaim "Ah! Now I get it!". This film won't provide you with some twist ending or have a character come up to the lead and explain it all. It's not supposed to make perfect sense or be easily explainable. It's not real. It's fantasy. Fiction. The whole film is like a dream, or, more appropriately, a nightmare. The film is great; it's just not for me. I won't let that affect my rating, however. This was an excellent example of masterful film-making. Lynch's direction is eminent, evidenced by the fact that I kept watching, despite not understanding half of what was going on or being able to sympathize with any character(something we are much too used to from mainstream movies). The lighting is great. Lynch really plays around with it, and it's always interesting to look at. It also really adds to the mood, nicely set by careful editing and music usage. The acting is flawless, and that is not a term I use lightly. All in all, a wonderfully well-done film, but definitely not for everyone. Wasn't in my tastes, but I enjoyed how well-made it was regardless. I recommend this to fans of art films, rather than conventional ones. Fans of Lynch should enjoy this. Very surreal and loose. 10/10
Buckle your seat belts: this film is quite the ride. As so often with David Lynch's movies, 'Lost Highway' doesn't bother with a traditional narrative and follows its own, dreamlike (or nightmarish) logic. It is a wild, expressionist work of art, and while it starts on a slow, brooding note, the film soon explodes into a crazy, violent trip that hooks you competely and doesn't let up. My advice to people unfamiliar with Lynch's work is this: just enjoy the experience and let yourself be immersed. While it is fun to analyze Lynch's movies, especially his most surreal ones, they're not mysteries that require resolution in order to be enjoyed.As for the filmmaking itself, the pacing is fantastic throughout, the cinematography outstanding and the cast of character actors like Bill Pullman, Robert Loggia and Patricia Arquette simply a joy to watch (especially Loggia gets to shine in a wonderfully over-the-top part). Another aspect that should not go unmentioned is the music. The orginal score by Angeolo Badalamenti (who is to Lynch what John Williams is to Spielberg) is hauntgingly beautiful, but equally important is the amazing soundtrack - featuring greats like David Bowie, Lou Reed, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Trent Reznor and more - which fits and enhances the images on screen perfectly.As far as I'm concerned, this is Lynch at his best. 'Lost Highway' is a dark, violent, surreal, beautiful, hallucinatory masterpiece: 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/
I believe it was the legendary Homer Simpson who once gave the ideal description on David Lynch productions. During watching a Twin Peaks'-episode he said, `Brilliantbut I don't get it'. Too trueyou love what you're seeing and you want to be a part of the mysterious Lynch universe! You actually feel the urge to search for solutions, you want to solve the riddle that is Lost Highway and you desperately try to do sountil you realize it's in fact a puzzle that cannot be solved. Therefore, my advice would be: Don't try to be Einstein and develop too many theories' just get overwhelmed by Lost Highway and enjoy the mixture of weirdness, violence and erotica you get to see. It's amazing what David Lynch pulls off here! He serves an absurd and impossible structure that involves an inexplicable metamorphosis of the protagonist and he actually gets away with it!! Meanwhile, he introduces a bunch of bizarre  but extremely fascinating  characters of which you don't know they're real or just creations of a mentally ill mind. Lynch in top-condition, in other wordsyou almost start to suspect he's laughing with his audience.  The quality of Lost Highway is brought up to an even higher level by the terrific musical score (Angelo Badalamenti), a blasting soundtrack (Rammstein!) and sublime acting. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Ghetty supply each other terrifically, even though they don't have ONE scene together. And Patricia Arquetteeither blond or brunette looks gorgeous. No wonder men in this film fall into madness over her. Lost Highway comes with my highest possible recommendation, yet I still prefer the David Lynch of the lat 70's and 80's. Can't really give a reasonable explanation for this Films like Blue Velvet and Eraserhead had something extra.
The jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is married with Renee (Patricia Arquette) and they live in a comfortable house. Fred is suspicious of the relationship of Renee with her friend Andy (Michael Massee). One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the doorstep of their house and when they watched the footage, they find that someone has broken in to film inside their house. They call the police, but the two detectives do not find any clue. Fred and Renee go to a party at Andy's house and Fred has a bizarre encounter with a mysterious man (Robert Blake) that tells him that they have met before and he is at Fred's house. The upset Fred calls Renee and they go back home. On the next morning, Fred finds another videotape and when he watches the film, he sees a bloodbath with Renee murdered in bed with him. He is found guilty of murder of first degree and sentenced to the electric chair. While waiting in the death row, he morphs into the efficient mechanic Peter Raymond Dayton (Balthazar Getty) and is released from the cell, but followed by two detectives. Pete fixes the car of the powerful and dangerous gangster Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) and when he meets his mistress Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette), they have a love affair and the woman convinces him to escape with her from Mr. Eddy and travel to some other place. "Lost Highway" is one of the most intriguing, bizarre and challenging cult-movies that is to be loved or hated but never fully understood. I believe that even David Lynch that directed and wrote "Lost Highway" does not have answers for all the mysteries of the plot. The best and most provocative scene is when the mysterious man tells Fred that he is at his house and gives a cellular to Fred to call him. The film is shot following the style of film-noir and Patricia Arquette is the "femme fatale". The beauty of the half-naked Patricia Arquette is astonishing and her strip-tease is very erotic. The soundtrack with music of David Bowie, Angelo Badalamenti, Rammstein, Lou Reed, and Tom Jobim (with Insensatez") is spectacular. Last time I had watched this movie was on 23 December 1999. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Estrada Perdida" ("The Lost Highway")
'I like to remember things my own way. Not necessarily the way they happened.' These are the words of Fred Madison (Bill Pullman), a man with an unfair share of problems. He lives in a deadly quiet neighbourhood, in a dark, oddly designed house. He works as a jazz musician in a nightclub and suspects his beautiful wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) of cheating on him. But, without knowing it, he's caught in an infinite, time-travelling, paradox conundrum. Confused? It gets even more complex.Someone is leaving sinister video tapes on their doorstep. At first it only shows the exterior of their house. But the subsequent tapes reveal a little more and more.At a party hosted by one of his wife's sleazy 'friends' a mystery man appears out of the crowd and tries to convince Fred that they've met before. Not quite aware of the true nature of the nightmare he's falling into, Fred dismisses this man as crazy and promptly leaves the awful party. At home, Fred disappears into the shadows of the labyrinthine hallway and isn't seen again til next morning.The last videotape reveals Fred brutally murdering and dismembering Renee. Only he cannot remember doing it. Caught by the cops and sent to prison awaiting the chair, Fred begins to suffer agonising headaches. Then, one night, in solitary confinement, he goes through a psycho-genetic fugue and transforms into a completely different person.Next morning the guards and warden are freaked to discover Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), a 24-year old mechanic, in Fred Madison's cell. With no choice but to let him go, Pete goes back to his parents house while closely tailed by the cops. Something has happened to Pete a few days earlier and his parents are keeping their mouths shut. They can barely comprehend it themselves and it appears that Pete is involved in the same nightmare plot as Fred Madison was.A powerful gangster named Dick Laurent/Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia)has a fondness for Pete and his ability to fix any car. But when he swings by the garage with his new floozy Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette again) he falls instantly in love with the woman, despite having 'femme fatal' practically tattooed, in bold, on her forehead.Pete and Alice begin a relationship of nothing but aggressive shagging. And slowly, but surely, a world of mystery unlike anything you've ever seen is so vividly realised that you are practically pulled right into the film itself. The atmosphere is so thick that it'll flood over into your living room.David Lynch's direction is honed to perfection. The cinematography is flawless and expertly framed. Lynch is a master of space and sound and the world of Lost Highway is at once beautiful and downright evil. He uses sly editing tricks to keep you paying the utmost attention and even if you don't take your eyes off the screen for a slit second it will still takes dozens of viewings to even begin solving it.The ingenuity of Lost Highway is that it can be interpreted in so many ways but there is always one piece of the puzzle that Lynch has deliberately warped or hammered out of shape so that it doesn't fit and negates any theory you may have. You could spend hours (and I have) painstakingly trying to make sense of it all and you can some close to the answer but be so far from the truth. Be it a dream or reality, a trip down the Lost Highway is one you seriously need to take. Though you might not come back.
(Don't read this unless you want it explained). Fred found out that his Wife had done adult films in the past. She promised him she wouldn't do it again. He can't handle it. He's super stressed out about it and can only feel release through playing jazz and having frenetic sex with his Wife. His behavior freaks her out.She starts to reconnect with her friendships she had neglected due to her marriage. One of them is a former adult film producer/star with whom she had worked years before. Fred sees her talking to him at the party. Their somewhat over friendly behavior gets Fred really angry. They return home with Fred still seething. His Wife tells him that Dick Laurent wants her to go back to her adult film career. His hatred for her past life explodes in a moment of rage when he murders Her in their bedroom. This is the Woman he loves and married. How dare She dirty them both? He gets arrested and thrown in Jail.While in jail he reminisces about when he met her when He was younger (as Balthazar Getty), more carefree and when She was still pure in his mind. This is why we see two version of his Wife, One pure and clean the other dark and dirty. The fantasy image he wants to hold onto vs the dirty whore. He has fantasies of killing Dick Laurent too, but he can't because he is in jail. His mind finally cracks and he goes crazy, his mind wanting to only remember the good things, but the truth of the horror of his actions keep invading his thoughts. This is what the Mystery Man is. Truth. The truth about his guilt. This is why he follows Fred whever he goes. Because the Truth of our bad actions will always haunt us. Just like the intrusive video tapes. It could be argued then that the whole movie is Fred sitting in jail stewing in insane grief and guilt, yearning to escape and run free ... down The Lost Highway.
I started this film upon renting it one night at 11:00 PM.  I finished at about 1 in the morning.  I was so stunned and awestruck that I stayed up until 3 in the morning to watch it again.  This is one of the most spell-binding movies I have ever seen.  Each time I see it my theory of the plot thickens.  What I love about the movie is that it leaves you with the option to fill in the blanks.  You will keep asking what happened and why that happened, but that is what makes the movie so awesome.  David Lynch's skewed opinion of reality is very inspiring and I feel that my reality has changed ever since I watched it.  Having watched it 13 times I can pretty safely say that my theory of the plot is set, but I still love to ponder exactly why.
Are you confused? or disturbed? or paranoid? or turned on? or all of the above? If you've answered "All of the above", congratulations, you've had a terrific David Lynch experience. Lost Highway isn't one of Lynch's better known films. Perhaps its not as whimsically demented as Eraserhead or as nightmarish as Blue Velvet. But PLEASE don't let this one pass you by. This is a terrific mind-bender. This movie creeps you out in the best ways Lynch can. He leaves us hanging with a few mysterious characters, all of whom not knowing who they are, and more importantly, not knowing what they're doing. At the picture's end, we still don't know.. but we've enjoyed the wild ride while it lasted. Terrific performances abound. Patricia Arquette is at her best here, I definitely got an Alabama Whitman vibe here. The cameos are the best. An insane Robert Loggia, a strangely subdued Gary Busey. Legendary comedian Richard Pryor given merely (and I'm not joking) a minute of screen time.. and he kills it. But the best part, and undoubtedly the creepiest character and element of this picture is Robert Blake. Terrifying is a word that appropriately describes him here. It doesn't help that he's Robert Blake either.
Clearly, as with most of David Lynch's films, Lost Highway is not for everyone.  It is, as Lynch intended it to be, a film realization of a dream. In this regard, it is comparable, in terms of artistry and raw intensity to Kurosawa's _Dreams_.  Indeed, in terms of sensory experience - cinematography and sound, for example - Kurosawa and Lynch have few rivals. However, the comparison falls away rather quickly in consideration of the film's content.  Lost Highway is really no dream, but a nightmare.Let's face it, like it or not, everything Lynch does is intentional.  This film has inspired polarized reviews here on IMDB.  Those looking for a plot-heavy movie that they do not necessarily have to pay attention to tend to despise it.  Those who are open to allowing this manipulative, intensely disturbing and thought-provoking film to carry them into its own parcel of hell love it.  This is, in my opinion, what good art can do.Like a dream, Lost Highway has as many plots as it does viewers with their own individual interpretations and perspectives.  It forces itself upon you with a vengeance, but simultaneously encourages the kind of disengagement you experience when you are conscious that you are dreaming.I recommend Lost Highway highly.  See it with intelligent, open-minded friends who like to talk about film experiences.  And expect that the conversation will keep you up way past your bed time.
I absolutely loved this movie. I have always loved to watch a good flick that puts my brain to the test. Maybe the film isn't suppose to make much sense, but that's what I love about it. You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just took place. This movie isn't for a lot of people and I mean a lot. You have to like movies like Mulholland Drive, Memento, The Man Who Wasn't There, etc.. to even begin to like this one. I'm not necessarily a big David Lynch fan, but this movie rocked big time.     One of the most eery parts of the film is when (Bill Pullman) is making love to his wife (Patricia Arquette) and her face turns into the mystery man (Robert Blake). A very freaky looking individual, indeed. In my eyes, he represents the devil. But, that's my take on it.     Another great scene is when Pete is making love to Patricia Arquette in the Desert. The lighting, music, camera angles, emotions and everything is just one of the best pieces of cinemtography I've ever seen in my life.      My recommendation is this: If you liked Mulholland Drive, Memento, Pulp Fiction, Fargo, The Man Who Wasn't There, Blue Velvet, then this movie is your cup of tea. If not, don't waste your time, cause you'll hate it, more than likely. 3 1/2 *'s out of 4 *'s.
This was the first time I was in anticipation of the release of a David Lynch film.  Having only discovered his movies (and Twin Peaks) in the period of 1992-1997.   I became a huge fan, owning several films on video as well as the complete Twin Peaks series.I was not disappointed with Lost Highway.  A film that left me totally stunned.  A film that I did not want to end, in the hope that I could figure out what was going on.  A film that left some scenes imprinted on my brain like a tattoo.   A film that is a dream.This film is what dreams are.  There are times when you feel you control the dream, and times where you feel it escapes you.  Slow and rapid events. Images that don't make sense.  Fantasy. Horror.  Surrealism.  Symbolism. All part of a long dream, that I doubt anyone can decipher, including Mr Lynch.Seeing this film for the second time with a person who truly did not "get it" (though I thank her for her patience to watch the whole film), made realise that there are two kinds of people in this world.  I love this film. I can't wait to watch it again.
The first time I watched this movie I enjoyed it but was left confused as to what was really going on. As a huge fan of Lynch I was expecting as much. So a few days later I watched it again and everything clicked and made perfect sense and seemed so obvious this time.If you hated it the first time and found nothing interesting then you probably shouldn't watch it again and put yourself though the torture a second time. But if you feel how I did, watch it again and you'll enjoy it much more.This movie does require a second viewing for a complete understanding of what's happening. In Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire you get what's going on the first time. Multiple viewings make the details much clearer but you don't leave confused like with Lost Highway.Great story, the first part is truly one of the scariest things I've ever seen. I think one thing about this movie that is interesting is that almost all of the actors are playing roles that you've never seen them do before. And they do it very well. I was a little apprehensive about Pullman being the lead, as I know him from Spaceballs and Independence Day, but he is very good in this. You rarely get a bad performance in a Lynch movie.My only criticism is that the movie is a little slow and long. Not in a bad way but I do find myself waiting for the end as opposed to some movies where I don't want them to end.
I'm not going into the plotline here because I'm limited to 1000 words.  I don't think I can wrap up the plot that space.I'm a recent inductee into the strange and twisted world of David Lynch. It all started when I caught a rerun of "Twin Peaks" on a low-budget digital satellite channel.  Since then I've been hooked, and have had fun with cult films and filmmakers since.Lost Highway is, as descried by Lynch, a new twist on film-noir.  And only Lynch could put a twist like this on a classic genre.  People keep wanting to draw comparisons to other films, saying: "Well, it's not Blue Velvet" or "It's not Mulholland Dr,"...they're right.  It's Lost Highway, a unique and twisted foray down a dark highway that may or may not be entirely metaphorical...or metaphysical.One of the things that I've noticed about David Lynch--and what probably inspires much of the hatred non-Lynch fans have towards his work--is that he doesn't explain everything.  He lays it out, says "Here's my story.  What do YOU make of it?"  It's an incredible artistic attitude, much like viewing a Dali painting as opposed to a Da Vinci, and not for everyone's tastes.Lost Highway is open to many interpretations, as are most of Lynch's works. Are we in our world, and being invaded by some outside force?  Are we in a world we don't know we're in?  Are we in Hell?  What would you do if this happened to you?  Maybe we are all someone else, really.
This film is at the same time allegorical, philosophical, incomprehensible, and satirical.  It warps understood movie conventions, and is always pulling the unexpected.All that praise aside, it is NOT the best of Lynch's work.  One would have to be a fan to enjoy this, and should establish that fanhood with his better works, like Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, or "Twin Peaks."
If one has a set standard of how movies should be, an A-B-C pattern, stay away.  But if it's originality, unanswered questions, and a break from standard Hollywood convention, go full ahead.In my humble opinion, it's better than Wild at Heart and Dune, but not most of Lynch's rest.  It is definitely an experience, but not one everybody will enjoy.
First of all let me say, that it is not as serious, if you don't get the movies of David Lynch at once (or even never). Lynch is not a film maker who tries to make movies with a problem-solving message, but an artist. Moreover he started as a painter and so he tries to create an atmosphere more than to develop a story.Most viewers will have realized that "Lost Highway" is a story about a schizophrenic murderer (even Lynch mentioned it). But that is not the complete clue to the movie. Cause everyone is aware of Fred's metamorphosis (although no one seems to really care about). So his mutation seems to be real and till the end no one proves the opposite! But "Lost Highway" is not a common movie about schizophrenia like "Beautiful Mind" or "Das weiße Rauschen" (Which is a must-see, too!). INSANITY IS NOT THE SUBJECT, BUT THE NARRATIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE MOVIE! In other words: The movie is not a presentation of mental sickness, but a complete sick presentation, which means that the subjective perception of the protagonist becomes the objective reality! You'll find this way of telling a story quite often in surrealistic literature (i.e Franz Kafka's "Die Verwandlung" engl.: "Metamorphosis" - just note the title!!).All Lynch-Movies refer to mental illness or the state of dreaming: No character ever seems to care about the illogical and irrational twists of the plot(just like in dreams), the landscapes are unrealistic and change appearance or size and the story takes place at deserted areas (forests, claustrophobic rooms, industrial areas, desserts) far away from civilization or reality!Insanity - Sanity/ Evil - Good/ Reality - Fiction are no longer categories one can rely on. The protagonists see their surroundings and environment always threatening, but they never question it! They act with such a matter of course, that one has to ask whether it is ignorance, naiveté or self-deception. Perhaps you don't have to ask yourself how far you are able to UNDERSTAND the message. Perhaps you have to ask yourself how far you are willing to ACCEPT the message. Be aware, that once you started seeing the world at a different way you will follow that white rabbit right the way in his burrow...
All hail David Lynch. All hail the other David Lynch.Lynch is not a complex man, I think; it is easy to read him. But he is cinematically articulate and its a pleasure of a special sort when you meet an articulate artist. His interest is simply described: duals.All his films work with some exploration of this idea. What makes him interesting is that he doesn't work the usual way, with a reality and then a surreal overlay. Both elements in his experiments are what we coarsely call "surreal." The game in traveling with him is an investment in the idea that there is no anchor to reality, that all references are among imaginations, sometimes twisted. "Mulholland" was a little too conventional for me because you could actually explain things and one of the realities was sorta real if you ignored a few things.My favorite Lynch is "Velvet," which imposes the two warring realities on film genres. The most fun is the seemingly straight "Straight" story, which is perhaps the most bizarre encounters of dual strangeness because it seems so ordinary. Dualing roots that keep getting mowed.But if you are into Lynch, this is an extraordinary pleasure, this one. Its the most obvious in plan, the least hidden in the swirl of two worlds. Neither world is anchored in reality and each hallucinates the other. Probably the only anchor with reality is the most disturbing character in appearance, The Robert Blake guy.But even these two surrealities are nested in cinematic realities. One is the gangster movie, elevated to cosmic status by the French new wave. The other is visual jazz and the accompanying dream linkages that have been similarly blazed, starting with Dennis Hopper so far as American films.What you are open to determines what you can get, I suppose. What Lynch provides is a sort of post-post modern notion of film as sometimes centered in itself, with its own cosmologies and lives that always refer to other film notions and never to real ones. There is no fold of us as viewer, no acknowledgment of our world at all (except for the mysterious videos). Celestial madness.I prepared for this by watching four bad Holmes movies in a row. How we detect and discover is what this is about and is so superior to what we normally encounter, you should watch it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.
As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music.So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places.Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home.Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelgänger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up.As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become.This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride.Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyoncé woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it.As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "fücking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.
Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is told that "Dick Laurent is dead". He plays the saxophone. He and his wife Renée (Patricia Arquette) are hounded by someone unknown. A mystery man, supposed to be a friend of Dick Laurent, meets Fred at a party. Fred is jailed for brutally murdering Renée. In prison, his identity changes to Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty). Pete is released for being the wrong guy. Sheila (Natasha Gregson Wagner) is his girlfriend. He's a mechanic working at a garage owned by Arnie (Richard Pryor). Gangster Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) needs his car repaired and Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette) is his mistress.David Lynch has made something confusing. Following this logically may be a fool's errant. The problem is that it's not terribly compelling either. It grinds along like a car stuck in first gear. It is impossibly slow with an unknowable story. When the switch happens, the movie goes into a WTF restart. I'm not sure I care about the first part. At least, the second part has the great Robert Loggia.
I make no secret about David Lynch being my favourite ever director. He makes films like no other by building dark worlds which draw you in by putting you in some sort of spell. I love him so much that I put off seeing Lost Highway for over a year because it was the only David Lynch film I was yet to see. I was even considering not seeing it at all just so I could always have that one new David Lynch film, but then I thought that would just be ridiculous. Also, the revival of Twin Peaks was enough to pique my David Lynch anticipation meter to breaking point so I finally gave in and stuck in Lost Highway.Firstly, I don't think it's as grossly strange as some people make out. Yes, it has all the trademark bizarreness you come to expect from David but the majority of the film is surprisingly linear. I was expecting some next level INLAND EMPIRE stuff the way some folk bang on about it! The first 40 minutes are like Michael Haneke's Hidden in dream form. It's probably some of the best stuff our David has ever done due to the inexplicably tense and hellish atmosphere. A lot of the scariness is down to the terrifying music which ranges to ominous drones to extremely loud strings. There's one seriously nightmarish image near the start (which I've never heard anyone talk about, surprisingly) which sent chills up my spine. It's a full-on Lynchian assault on the senses which takes you down some dark and enthralling corners. The atmosphere is chock-a-block full of mystery.There are endlessly beautiful scenes including Fred playing the saxophone, the unsettling meeting with the Mystery Man and extremely frightening dream sequences. I think it's also important to note the expert positions David places the camera. There always seems to be too much space surrounding the characters and it makes for seriously eerie viewing. There's also that fantastic Francis Bacon inspired colour scheme of dark purples/pinks and shadows. He really does direct the hell out of the first forty minutes of this film.Suddenly the film changes into something entirely different as soon as Fred Madison randomly transforms into a young mechanic called Pete Dayton and takes on an entirely new life. No one seems to bat an eyelid about Fred Madison disappearing and the sudden change is quite jarring. In my opinion, this is when the film goes down a gear. I think because the first story is so strong, this second one pales slightly in comparison as the suffocating atmosphere somewhat dissipates and the overall strangeness ceases. Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot to love it just feels less Lynchy and more straightforward, and the Pete Dayton story is the biggest chunk of the film.There are still some spectacular sequences though, including a mysterious gangster getting road rage and Patricia Arquette's intriguing Alice character. There's also a strong feeling of everything not quite being what it seems and it gives you time to ponder over exactly what the heck you're watching. Thankfully for us weirdos things do start to get extremely strange towards the final half hour of the film before breaking down into total chaos until your mind finally explodes.Lost Highway is extremely puzzling in a similar way to Mulholland Dive. All of the clues seem to be there as well as a few abstractions to throw lots of spanners into the works (what does this Mystery Man have to do with it all!?) but there is a complex and very intelligent story buried underneath all the bizarreness. It feels like a warm-up exercise before Dave finally broke the mould of film with Mulholland Drive. Everything in Mulholland feels like a perfected version of Lost Highway from the more passionate love story to the unrelenting dreamlike atmosphere.Lost Highway is still a film to cherish on the Lynchian canon though. It's very much its own thing and I felt a strong urge to see it all again once it had all finished. Unlike Mulholland Drive there doesn't seem to be a universal theory to Lost Highway which makes it all the more interesting to watch again and again to dig for clues. However, as with all Lynchy films the best thing to do is just sit back and let your intuition drive you rather than your brain. It's not an IQ test but a piece of art which is designed to take you on a journey. No one makes films that make you feel quite like David Lynch does. Let's hope that the Twin Peaks revival encourages our Dave to get back into more regular filmmaking again. I couldn't bear to wait another ten years!
I'm actually feeling pretty good about things: I've been liberated. After seeing *part of 'Lost Highway', a life's truth has been revealed: I don't ever have to see another David Lynch film. Hip, hip, hooray!*The more you see, the more "mysterious" the film becomes, or, putting it another way, the sewage of this guy's mind, badly transferred from film to DVD, in this case,(or perhaps that was the **'look' he wanted) finally bored/aggravated me enough to turn my interests to more engaging things. **Which look was physically and mentally off-putting and tiring.....literally.Having spent some years in the film industry,and got to know a couple of dozen producers somewhat, I marvel that Lynch can get the financing to make a film as miserable as 'Lost Highway'. This may be his greatest talent. (How does he convince some financially tough hombres to invest in a story of such low merit?)So I'll extend myself in the future, with as much time and energy as I can, to continue trying to get Criterion to restore the films of Satjajit Ray, perhaps the greatest filmmaker, who struggled his entire career to raise funds for his movies. Final comment about some previous rave reviews of L.H.: Comparing Lynch's writing/ideas to Kafka's suggests a superficial misread; Lynch revels in obfuscation while Kafka torturously and brilliantly tries for meaning.
The thing that's great about Lost Highway is there is no absolute solution to the events in the film, everything about the film is open to interpretation and after you watch it you either need to thing and talk about it for a couple of hours or watch it again. In Mulholland Drive, people say that it needs to be watched twice to be fully understood. Lost highway needs to be watched about 3 or 4 time to be slightly understood and will probably never be fully understood. All the clues are there in the film but to include all of them to make sense is very difficult. However it is very rewarding to try and find out the meaning of Lost Highway.Although it is described as a modern film-noir, it's more inspired by Alfred Hitchcock. The use of music to increase the suspense of the film is used a lot here and in many Hitchcock films such as Psycho. Even if you cant work out what it is about, it is still a very tense thriller.Final Score  10/10
Someone said that Lynch has said that Fred was a schizophrenic murderer. Well yes, he either killed or had Dick Laurent killed. I don't believe he killed his wife. We see the evil mobster Mr.Eddy showing snuff films in his house where someone apparently is murdered in it on the TV screen. Which seems to represent true images. Why not just porno, of course it makes Eddy look more menacing but is that necessary? Showing the snuff film is not an accident, it is necessary to the plot. We see Arquette with the mobster watching the snuff film on the TV late in the film. She makes films for a guy she knows kills people on film, she is embracing him and letting him have his way with her We never actually see Fred murder his wife. In fact Fred in the video before he is punched by the police Fred clearly has no weapon in his hand and is in shock. Why leave the weapon out of the video if Fred killed his wife? Given the people she was in with why isn't it a possibility that unbeknownst to her she was put in a snuff film, murdered, and then brought back to her house so as to frame the murder on Fred? Fred comes home sees the body and could have very well been forced to play in the gore by whoever was behind the camera. Tape ends up with the police, case closed. As far as Fred as a man he is obviously not a big time musician, he is playing in a small club. The house he and his wife share is a multi-million dollar house there is no way Fred could afford that kind of house on what he makes. So he marries a woman who has a multi-million dollar house and doesn't know what she does for a living?(heck it might even be Eddys house that would explain the horrible vibe in the house) No way. The laugh they share at the beginning of the film when Arquette says she is going to 'read' when he is out tells us all. So out of the window goes the explanation that Fred and his happy wife were plodding along and suddenly he discovers she is in porno and kills his wife, Andy, and Eddy. He had to have known she was in porno and aligned with Andy and Eddy, million dollar houses don't grow on trees. That also explains why the satanic character in the film tells Fred: 'You invited me into your house, it is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted'. He invited evil into his house by living with the knowledge that his wife was a professional whore, and associated with wholly evil men. This analysis is also backed up by the fact that Fred sees the mystery man/satanic character briefly imposed on his wife's face. This sends a clear message and clearly explains how he got 'into the house' it was through Fred's wife and her evil conduct.Fred lived with his wife day in and day out with some childish notion he could 'save' her from her degraded life.(which is represented by the way the naieve Pete character treats her) When it was in fact her choice to live it, and in fact Fred benefited greatly from that life materially. He had cars, million dollar house, nice clothes, status. So really his romantic notion to save his wife was self-deception. Fred liked the life his wife's evil afforded him.However at some point he found out that his wife was in snuff films where people got killed. Instead of at this point realizing the total and complete degradation of his wife and leaving her. He hangs onto his fantasy image of his wife being forced into participating. Blames Laurent, and has him killed.Killing Laurent sets up the horrific chain of events. Laurents partner in crime, the sleazy guy at the party finds out about Fred's hit on Laurent. Which is shown in the film at the party, we see the instant where it becomes known to the sleazy guy that Fred had something to do with the death of Laurent. The sleazy guy is the one responsible for the videotapes that get the police involved. If hes not why have the long setup with the series of videotapes? He is the one who kills Freds wife to set Fred up. They probably even force Fred to play in the gore while they tape it as an added punishment.The film is incredible it really shows the type of person that lives a life like Fred. Fred is utterly human, and I think anyone who tries to write him off as 'mentally ill' would have trouble doing so. After watching the film one must admit there's a little bit of Fred in all of us.(some more than others :)
There, that title alone is enough to get fans to cringe and generate torrents of seething hatred now. This film is a Lynch film, it is therefor a mystery/crime with a very strong emphasis on the mystery...and the crime. But in both cases, an extreme version. So extreme in fact is the mystery, that it never actually unravels its coherent meaning, for simply, there is none. This sounds all very seductive to the pseudo-intellectual, but for others this comes across as clearly lacking a coherence even within the incoherence, an order in the chaos attempted. This comes across as way, way too many sex scenes, unnecessary violence to cover up strong plot work, easily too much length, and ultimately an artist abusing his status in creating lazy and complacent pudding: it's sweet, it looks good, but it's amorphic. Shape cannot entirely replace content, and if the content is to be this sort of fantastic network of vistas and concepts then it should at least provide a certain understanding to its public, some light along the dark alley. Lost Highway is interesting visually, pretty enjoyable to watch, but it really doesn't amount to anything of any valuable quality when it comes to an actual resolution of the plot and never provides the fullness in meaning, the satisfaction of understanding the whole. This film may have a compelling, abstract narrative to start with but it becomes so very self-indulgent towards about the last third, and it just goes on and on and on... Sincerely not a great film. Not as well made as 'Blue Velvet', to give an example, made a decade earlier. 5/10.
Lost Highway is not Lynch at his most accessible, that would be Blue Velvet followed by The Elephant Man and The Straight Story, and I would put those films as well as Mulholland Drive (one of his most polarising along with Eraserhead) as better films of his, but while it has divided and will divide viewers I did love the film. Lost Highway does occasionally get confusing (particularly from a psychological stand-point) as a result of trying to have too many ideas, which does seem to be what the main complaint is against it, but for me there was very little wrong (as a bit of advice it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style first with The Elephant Man or Blue Velvet being the best place to start). Lost Highway looks amazingly stylish, the cinematography some of the best of any film personally seen in a while, the colours are expressive and bursting with colour and hypnotism and the images are surreal but impeccably hypnotising. Lynch's directing is highly accomplished if not quite some of his best directing like Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet. He also does a great job in not making Lost Highway too formulaic (there is a sense that formally and structurally that there was a fair bit of re-invention involved), in fact it was one of the freshest and most unique psychological mystery thrillers personally viewed. Like Eraserhead, Lost Highway is basically an atmosphere/mood piece and it works amazingly as one. It may be Lynch at his strangest but that made the film even more fascinating to watch, no matter what you think of some of the story the impact the atmosphere has in the film cannot be denied. The thriller elements are enough to set the pulse racing and the mystery elements while made obvious about half-way through have a lot of suspense. Bill Pullman's exemplary here, some of the best work he's ever done even, and standouts too are Patricia Arquette at her most sensual and Robert Blake at his creepiest. The music score is incredibly haunting with fitting use of pre-existing songs and while spare the dialogue doesn't stick out like a sore thumb too much. All in all, a bizarre film but with the mood it has and how well-made and directed it is it is a very compelling one too. Not Lynch at his best but around the top end of his filmography. 9/10 Bethany Cox
A beautiful and very emotional "Harry and Tonto"-styled movie experience as Oscar-nominee Richard Farnsworth (playing the real-life Alvin Straight) decides to travel on his old riding John Deere mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother (Harry Dean Stanton) because his driver's license has been revoked, he doesn't like public transportation and he has no one else to drive him. The two brothers have not been on speaking terms for many years and now the clock is literally ticking on one last chance for them to see one another and hopefully make amends for past mistakes. Sissy Spacek gives one of her finest performances as Farnsworth's slightly mentally retarded daughter and the supporting players are all real and heartfelt caricatures of America's heartland. Outstanding film-maker David Lynch (to me the finest living American director, along with Martin Scorsese) goes totally out-of-character with a 180-degree turn from whacked triumphs like "The Elephant Man", "Blue Velvet", "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Mulholland Dr.". He quietly and methodically creates a G-rated family film that has deep messages for people of all ages and backgrounds. He paints a picture of America where the old ways of life are still the most important. Farnsworth (who is a total revelation) was in excruciating pain throughout filming due to terminal cancer and terrible arthritis. Notice he stands very little in the movie and he is almost always filmed from the waist up. Sadly this would be his final performance as he committed suicide shortly after his Oscar nod. He did become the oldest nominee ever in the Best Actor category, but really that will become trivial as time passes and his role will be the thing that shines brightly forever. Truly a legacy production for all involved. 5 stars out of 5.
"A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this odd David Lynch film. This was especially "odd" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those "dark" films, too.This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an "odd" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released.The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his trip, the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill.I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this. Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way, such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but that's a joke: he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!The Iowa scenery is pleasant. I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil. It's a nice state with nice people....like this movie.
Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother, could possibly be good cinema? I certainly didn't. I thought I knew what to expect: one of the most boring experiences of my life. Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet, because this is one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've ever seen...Giving a short resume of "The Straight Story" isn't very difficult. It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke. That's already special on itself, but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument. In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems, but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life. Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks, not knowing if he will reach his goal: seeing his brother again before it's too late...I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that... This movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes, it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no, you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either, because there isn't any. But why should you watch it then? Well, the simple answer is the story. I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio's (that's right, the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense) makes it even more special. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it, probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me.Some people will argue that the story is very shallow, but I really don't agree with that. Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further. If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong, that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too, so they won't make the same mistake. If that isn't deep enough, how much deeper does a story have to go for you then? I would also like to add that this movie really had it all. Some beautiful landscapes (finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York, Chicago or some other big city), some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie. I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste. It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye. I give it the full 10/10.
No matter where you are on your journey, the meanders past, present and still to come, you'll take something from this endearing tale about an elderly man and his adventures on a very long journey to see his brother by mini tractor. Meeting and interacting with numerous people on his way, who each have a relatable story to share, along with a few the old timer shares with us - you're left feeling reflective on your own directions, what they mean and where it is they're taking you, and those around you too. Beautifully performed, filmed and scripted, it's never too late to rebuild bridges broken, or indeed, build new ones into the future.
David Lynch is a director known for the weirdness of many of his films. After all, he's helmed "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet", "Dune" and "Twin Peaks"--all very weird films by anyone's standards. However, here he's made a film that is very different in tone from his other famous work--and I wouldn't have suspected he could make such a 'normal' film. Perhaps this is because unlike most of his work, he didn't write "The Straight Story"--just directed it. Regardless, it's an exceptional film--one that is really unlike anything else I've seen--and I have seen and reviewed A LOT of films.The film is based on a true story that occurred a few years before the film was made. Alvin Straight was a 73 year-old man whose brother suffered a stroke. Alvin did not have a driver's license, as he had poor vision and was in pretty poor health. So, in order to make it to his brother's home hundreds of miles away, Alvin rigged up a trailer onto his riding mower and set out on a journey that would take him well over a month!While the subject matter is pretty mundane and the story rather slow-going (mostly because Alvin Straight's journey was a very slow one), the film managed to be quite entertaining. The script was excellent, Lynch's direction lovely and Richard Farnsworth was terrific in the film as Alvin Straight. Overall, despite being such a simple story, it is a very special sort of film--one that folks who don't demand action and excitement will enjoy.
Maybe I should be more specific. This film is great because of it's incredible story. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is an elderly man living with his daughter Rose Straight (Sissy Spacek) in Iowa. When he hears that his brother Lyle Straight (Harry Dean Stanton) had a stroke he heads over to his home in Wisconsin to check on him. But Alvin has no driver's license so he drives on a John Deere 110 lawn mower. It is based on the true story of Alvin Straight who drove his lawn mower to check on his suffering brother. What I like about this film is the story, the cinematography and especially the acting. Alvin drives and meets many people on his way, including a runaway girl, a bunch of cyclists, and a friendly family who fixes his tractor when it breaks. I don't want to give away the ending but it's really great. Check this one out.
Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. For some folks the idea of slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists, some part they long for contact with.I suppose it's a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I count myself in the camp of the latter group. I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological. This is indeed a journey story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin Straight, though I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us. Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for "acting" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.Given the realities of production economics, I'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly. An outsider to film production, I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression "time is money" is so accurately descriptive. Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story--he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. No simple task, that.If you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story. And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night.
73-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) from Laurens, Iowa takes a tumble. His challenged daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) is concerned. He won't let his doctor do tests. Then he receives word that his estrange brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) had a stroke. He is determined to go see his brother in Wisconsin. He can't drive and there's no bus. So he decides to modify his lawn mower for the long trip.This is an interesting little indie. There are a lot of tiny oddities in this. First this is directed by David Lynch without any of his usual surreal touches. He is really gentle here letting Farnsworth do his acting. There are some quirky touches here and there. He puts in some beautiful music. Spacek makes an interesting choice with her stutter. She has a funny moment in the beginning. Alvin is an old self-reliant guy. He's charming in his old school ways. The story is funny and bitter sweet.
Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b.s. detector goes off.  Usually, a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them, but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk.  So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews, I was apprehensive, especially since I was not a fan of his other "uplifting" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN.  For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film, it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us.I needn't have worried.  THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one.  Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part.  There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without, and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much, but those are only quibbles.  There's no heavy-handed message, no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions, and no condescension towards us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final scene, we are genuinely moved.Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part.  He really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres, and except for those homilies, the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental, because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long.  And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not only with his brother, but with his life.  Sissy Spacek also does fine, unmannered work as Straight's daughter.  And although I am a city and suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot, making me want at least to visit some day.
This is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie Lynch stuff. Rather, it's for those who either appreciate a good story, or have grown tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and Oprah-ish "This is such a wonderful movie! You must see it!"-semantics (tho' she IS right, for once!).The story unfolds flawlessly, and we are taken along a journey that, I believe, most of us will come to recognize at some time. A compassionate, existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.Acting is without faults, cinematography likewise (occasionally quite brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story.A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.
I like David Lynch and his movies, my favourites being The Elephant Man, Mulholland Dr, Blue Velvet and this. I don't think I can add very much to the previous reviews that sum it up so nicely, but I'll do my best. The Straight Story is not a complex movie, the script is quite simple but it didn't need to be. Despite its simplicity, the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it. The film is also quite meditative in its pace, but again that didn't bother me at all, because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate. Besides, even if they were flaws, which I don't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to The Straight Story, the film has a number of things to love about it. For one thing, the Straight Story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding. The score adds to the film's poignant tones, in terms of direction The Straight Story is one of Lynch's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too. Also Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance, he genuinely moved me and I felt for his character too. In conclusion, a beautiful film and one of Lynch's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox
I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade. As much as the film is G-rated, it's pure Lynch in style, pacing, and tone. The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power.The cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a Lynch film, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking. It's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly, kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either "good" or "evil".Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH, and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise it's received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch.'Straight Story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I've ever seen.  It's a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.
It takes patience to get through David Lynch's eccentric, but-- for a change-- life-affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick with it.  Though it moves as slow as Straight's John Deere, when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging, the painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation.  Richard Farnsworth caps his career with the year's most genuine performance, sad and poetic, flinty and caring.  And Sissy Spacek matches him as his "slow" daughter Rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad.  Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family.
I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting.  These I got.  What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence.  Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.If you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery).  The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount.  The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.
This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen: I glowed inside throughout the whole film. The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen. The slow pace was set by the mode of travel (a riding lawn mower with a big trailer) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow-paced lives of the other characters.The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters. Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across Iowa to visit his estranged brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.The film underscores the importance of family to this man and, hopefully, to all of us. I eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, this films proves his directorial skill. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.
The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America.  At one level a slow walk through the heartland, it's kind inhabitants, and amber grain, at another level about growing old and remembering what is important(and actively forgetting what isn't). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence. A remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come.
David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about but they really don't gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization.Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower. He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it's simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's so straight, so real.The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know this world is full of forgiveness.This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can't help but to understand his pride, to listen to his wisdom, and to ultimately feel his pain. One becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in.If there's justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth are together sitting at a bar. I can picture them discussing their lives, regrets, hopes, and joys. As Alvin says in the film, "My brother and I used to look up at the stars." Well, I know they all are with the best view in the house.
The Straight Story is a movie that's different from most I've seen. A man who's lived an aged life tries to enjoy every second to the fullest until the grave. After going to the doctor after one too many falls, though, he realizes his own mortality and the great impact it will have on those closest to him. As his life is slowly changing, he gets a call from his estranged brother, who's just suffered a stroke. People face numerous challenges throughout their lives. Some are overcome independently and some are even lifelong. Going across states while you can barely walk is one thing; driving across in a lawnmower is another. After facing turbulent weather, lonesome strangers and making unexpected friends along the way, this entire journey is a final reflection.Life is certainly short. It's best to make peace while we still can.
Titled after the family names of two brothers, The Straight Story is a true American classic. It would be a very good choice to watch, when you get together with your family.The Straight Story has its plainness and "straight"ness, as the first thing to say. The plainness segment includes no technical features; no audio or video aspects, no set decoration or cinematography work, no make-up and no costume. In fact with the use of this plainness David Lynch brings the restful country life to your view.Taking a road trip from Iowa to Wisconsin, a World War-II veteran plunges unhesitatingly into the river of his passion, driving his way with a 1966 John Deere lawnmower, and with his defect of eyesight. I didn't know the lawnmowers are made for traffic since I watch this film. Well, nothing is strange enough in David Lynch' s point of view. Despite this strangeness Lynch offers a complete sagacity through Alvin Straight(Richard Farnsworth)'s successful acting and Sissy Spacek as his daughter accompanying him. Thus, you get the straightness segment through those dialogues full of sagacity.Lynch has filmed his story along the roads that the real life Alvin Straight traveled in 1994. Wisely, Lynch dished out his work very economically except he has used a helicopter to let us see how slowly Alvin driving his lawnmower on the road from bird's eye-view. Still, Lynch could have cut some of the scenes which overshadow the smooth style of the film. His Straight Story taught us the importance of finishing whatever we started.
David Lynch's (1999) film of John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time well before the film's eventual release.We come into the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) late on in life. His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it.This makes what he decides to do, even more remarkable and endearing. He decides (and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put a few things straight.Alvin is, by this time in his life, a man of great experience but modest means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf. But it's worth it, because Rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses.This film is the story of a journey. But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. Early on in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake.But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective. His objective is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him. He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.Along the way, Alvin meets many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film. We come to know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better.
Spoilers herein.Lynch lives in a very troubled world. His pictures are characterized by being presented through the mind of the protagonist. Here, the protagonist is a simple old man, who thinks slowly and simply. So that's what we get. He has long erotic meditations on fecundity on the path of life (14 kids!), so that is what we see.Lynch must be laughing into his gasmask at those who think this is a Hallmark card. Consider these Lynchisms:-- the deerslaying woman (killed the same number of deer as Straight had kids)-- the man in the bar sharpening his knife-- the graveyard-- the `twin' with the jaw prosthetic-- the burning house-- the fat useless woman from next door-- the WWII hauntings-- the retarded daughter who has had her children taken away (and the mirror of the pregnant runaway who likely will also)-- the brother's glance at the end. Look at it again if you think it is appreciative reconciliation. That glance is why they needed an actor of the caliber of Stanton who was also familar to Lynch.Add to this the notion that Farnsworth knew he was dying and had already planned suicide. This is a very disturbed world, reinterpreted through the elder Kurosawan eye of the determined elder Straight to seem more desperately rosey than it is. Consider this like the first half of "Mulholland Drive," and a more intelligent film it is, because it asks you to provide the last half.The magic in the movie is not that it is saccharin, nor that it has strychnine, but that it is an homage to other filmmakers: Altman, Kurosawa, de Palma, Greenaway. Straight has his memories which he plays over and over, and so does Lynch.
...and arguably the simplest and most conventional. Wonderfully acted, achingly scored and shot, it's a real slow road movie - if it doesn't make you think about what it means to be old, then you are still (too?) young
This project was launched by David Lynch's editor (and future wife), Mary Sweeney, who secured the rights and co-wrote the screenplay, then it really took off when Lynch himself signed on to direct and stuntman-turned-character-actor Richard Farnsworth was "coaxed out of semiretirement" (I read somewhere online) to play the lead. As often seems to happen with "based on a true story" movies, the script gets stretched pretty thin at times (the parable about the sticks that Straight tells the teenage runaway seemed familiar from grade school), and the backstory that slowly emerges may seem a little too pat, but Farnsworth's disarmingly natural acting style is just right for the part, and Lynch's eye for the hidden beauty of the nondescript landscape and his perfect pacing bring out all the drama and poignancy of Alvin Straight's journey. Straight's story made me think of what Woody Grant in Alexander Payne's "Nebraska" might have been like if he'd managed to turn his life around.
THE STRAIGHT STORY is a film unlike anything else in David Lynch's body of work. It's a subtle, true-life tale about an old-timer who for various reasons decides to take a cross-country trip from Iowa to Wisconsin via his ride on lawnmower. Various adventures befall him and the film is largely made up of his quiet, introspective encounters with ordinary folk along the way. There is humour here but it's quiet and unforced, not loud and brash.This film is really the antithesis of the modern Hollywood film. There's no action, no character arcs, no big plot developments. Just a quiet sense of place and time and, most importantly of all, humanity. Richard Farnsworth was a former Hollywood stuntman dying of bone cancer during the production and his performance is heartfelt and heart-warming without ever being sentimental. It's a very well shot film that touches the heart in a unique way.
Upon The Straight Story release in 1999, it was praised for being David Lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal. Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere '66 mower, at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch's trademark motifs coming through.Lynch's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant, this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Almost universally acclaimed, the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism, that it wasn't a typical Lynch film. "Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G-Rated story that isn't his own." Brundage claims, with his protagonist Alvin Straight "quoting lines directly from Confucious." He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive - all films which I also adore, The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible. If you are a Lynch fan, it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature.The narrative is slow and thoughtful, which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination. Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife, children and his brother. Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks, which only adds to the effect, which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti, makes me yearn to go to America. The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent. His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win. Regardless, however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor. So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue, the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!
In 1999 David Lynch was tasked with this TV series pilot that was ultimately rejected by ABC. Once Lynch said in an interview that he is "a sucker for a continuing story". I think the remark is pretty down right. Look for instance at "Twin Peaks" and Lost Highway, both of which I am a big fan of. Also consider Inland Empire as well as all the post-2001 shorts, of which I am not a fan at all.Be as it may, in this one case the miracle happened. Lynch took the rejected pilot from the drawer and made it in a great full feature film, released in 2001, after re-shooting a few scenes and adding several others. Mulholland Dr. the feature, an apparently elusive but ultimately full sense-making story, is the best of Lynch's so far, in my opinion, and one of the best movies of the last twenty years.Now looking back at the pilot, I could not be more grateful that things went the way they did. The episode as such is great looking and builds up a lot of atmosphere. It is definitely of a far superior quality than the average TV show, probably even better than the "Twin Peaks" pilot. But precisely because of this, Mulholland Dr. the pilot deserved more than being just the first episode of a series (and of course more than being left in a drawer).When you consider it, the pilot has so many merits it is hard to believe it was made for TV. The score by Angelo Badalamenti, the cinematography by Peter Deming, the production design and the technical values in general are all top notch. And what's more, the acting is superb. Harring and Watts are mesmerizing and it is no surprise that they (especially Watts) went on to star careers after the full feature was released. Watts delivers according to her standards, i.e those of one of the best actresses of her generation. While the same cannot be said of Harring, she is nonetheless good and brings forth a lot of noir atmosphere, sheer sexiness and emotion. And the supporting cast also do an exceptional work, making all of the characters memorable. Just think of then relatively unknown Theroux playing the utterly unlikable film director or of veterans Hedaya and Forster. And of course, the characters are good because the dialog is so good.Overall, this is clearly not required viewing if you are not a hardcore fan of David Lynch, in which case go to the 2001 movie instead. However, if you already saw and liked the movie, the pilot becomes interesting as it shows how Lynch, for once, beautifully closed the loop. Something that I have missed him doing in the last ten years.
So the backstory of this TV Movie/Pilot is well-told, Lynch made this as a pilot for ABC. ABC didn't want it, so Lynch moved on. But, it still lingered in his mind a year afterward and decided to rework it into a feature film.And while this pilot is missing some of the best elements of the Film, it is still a well-acted, well-directed, well-shot, and thrilling TV Movie that has scenes that pretty much all ended up in the final feature film in 2001.And even with the poor quality of the copy I watched, it is still incredibly entertaining and there is a perfect atmosphere that lingers throughout the 89-minute runtime. I don't think this would have worked well as a TV Show, and it turning out to eventually be made into a feature is something that was the best thing that could have happened to this story, David Lynch, Naomi Watts, and Justin Theroux.The full pilot is on YouTube if you want to check it out, for a pilot it is quite amazing and I believe you won't regret watching it.
A great David Lynch film, augmented by a tour de force acting job by the very great Naomi Watts.This is a film that is brilliant in every way, surrealism at its best, and so very el lay.Love this film to death.
I can't get over this movie. WOW. How do I put what I feel into words? OK, let me give it a shot. Have you seen or felt something that leaves you wondering or sweeps your feet away? This movie does exactly that. The twists and turns that happen along the way just blows you away. I think you'd need to watch this movie a couple of times so you can at least "TRY" and comprehend what Lynch is trying to say. If this isn't the best movie I've watched, I don't know what is!20/10 rating if that was possible.
Honestly, I am really tired of this kind of movie after Twin peaks series this is getting boring after 20 mins - plot is confusing (as all Lynch works). I really liked twin peaks, but this movie pissed me off. It genius and hot but hard.
Just make it up as you go. This movie jumps from here to there and at the end you can't believe it was dream because the dreamer is dead..so what is it?...Like the TV show "Lost" this movie just makes stuff as it goes..
10/10Recently, I read an excerpt from a book by Dennis Lim called "David Lynch: The Man from Another Place." In it, the author mentions how much Lynch despises interpretation of his work. He writes:"Writing about David Lynch, it can be hard not to hear his voice in your head, protesting the violence being done to his work. 'As soon as you put things in words, no one ever sees the film the same way,' he once told me. 'And that's what I hate, you know. Talking—it's real dangerous.' Not for nothing does "Mulholland Drive," the Lynch movie that has invited the most fervent flurry of explication, end with a word of caution: 'Silencio.'"This reminded me that 11 years before this edit I had written this very review on IMDb, which contained an interpretation of the film's plot. I've decided to remove all of that. Whether or not you are satisfied with a particular interpretation of the plot should be irrelevant to your enjoyment of the film. I enjoyed it before I had that satisfying interpretation. And I'm hoping that I can clear it from my mind the next time I watch "Mulholland Dr."I will leave one thing from my original post. A quote by Peter Greenaway. "I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don't be a film maker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren't primarily to do with narrative."
This was my first David Lynch film and it left me completely stunned and amazed. You will have to come up with your own interpretation of the movie and that changed my view on movies and art as a whole. Recommended for everyone who wishes to see something truly unique and interesting.
After two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops at an odd location on Mulholland Drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. The bulk of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.The above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that's not the half of it. The film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. It's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around. Even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films--such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004)--you may not understand it on a second viewing, either. The studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director David Lynch write "10 clues to unlocking this thriller" and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the DVD. Lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be "real" and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that they're flashbacks.But is the film worth watching, or worth trying to figure out? That depends on your tastes, obviously. On a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers. But those qualities, and many other surrealist aspects of the film, are typical of Lynch. A prime Lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they're alien pod people trying to put on a front. If you're familiar with that style and like it, you'll find much to love here, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is fairly understated for Lynch. It's also worth noting, for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. It's not gratuitous, although I have no problems with gratuitousness, but is instead an important hinge in the film.Like all of Lynch's films, it's easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail. Any serious student of film (including "armchair students"/"cinephiles") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated. He includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. He lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name "Winkie's", and the "Hot Dogs--made for Pinks" sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. It's interesting to note that Lynch even apparently demands that the DVD programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.If the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you're just fond of "puzzles", then Mulholland Drive is well worth watching for that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. I won't recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it.For my money, however, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it is not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings). To me, though, the "twist" aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches, but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of Lynch's other films.Still, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. If you're serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch (as if those two would not necessarily coincide), you shouldn't miss this one.
SPOILERSSomebody commented here that nobody is supposed to understand this movie.  It's just David Lynch's weird mind and it'snot supposed to make any sense.  That's bull.  This movie has avery particular (and very very good) story line that is 100%understandable if you can do one thing; you have to understandthe sequence of events that Lynch twisted around so much.  Forthe convenience of everyone reading this (and anyone dying tounderstand this movie) I have set up the sequence of events as Iunderstand them.  Watch the movie again, and pay attention to the10 keys that Lynch provides.  Print this out if you need to : )Sequence of Events in Mulholland Dr. (according to wicket_saic@hotmail.com)  1.  Diane wins the Jitterbug contest.  Her family (the old man andold woman) is there and cheers for her.  (this is much earlier thanany of the rest of the movie.  years possibly)  2.  Camilla and Diane fool around on the couch (notice theashtray).  Camilla says that they shouldn't do that anymore.  3.  Camilla and the director talk and kiss in the car for the movie. 4.  Diane gets a phone call and is told to get in the limo.  She isdropped of at the bottom of the directors house.  The dinner sceneoccurs in which she finds out that her lover Camilla and thedirector are getting married.  5.  Diane sits in a restaurant with the hit-man and tells him to killCamilla.  6.  Diane returns home and feels guilty.  7.  She falls asleep on the pillow.   8.  Diane has a long dream.  What happens in this dream iscoming from guilt and the people surrounding her life.  Thedirector who is getting married to her x-lover has a terrible life.  Herx-lover loves her again.  Diane is an amazing actress and does agreat job.  The part with the men in the restaurant and the monsteris all just a part of the dream.  The cowboy has nothing to do withthe movie for the most part.  He was just seen by Diane at onepoint and he stuck with her so he's in her dream.  Her dead auntshows up.  She mixes up names just like everybody often does indreams.  None of this is real.  There are many things her dreamfeeds off of... to many things to try to explain.  The dream beginswith Camilla (Rita) in the car and ends with the cowboy waking herup.  That is all within her dream.  9.  A knocking wakes Diane up.  It is her neighbor looking for therest of her belongings.  She picks up her ashtray (notice the bluekey) and says that there are detectives looking for Diane.10.  While making coffee, Diane thinks she sees Camilla (whoshe just had killed).  Its just a daydream.11.  Diane goes and sits on the couch and stares at the blue key. Someone is knocking (I think that this could be the detectiveslooking for Diane).  The little people are her family representingher conscience.  She gets scarred of the knocking and thehaunting visions of her loved ones and she runs into her roomand shoots herself.THE ENDThis is the order in which the movie plays out.  See why it's soconfusing?1, 7, credits, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 end creditsHope this helps everyone and please stop saying that this moviehas no point and its just a bunch of thrown together scenes.  It hasa very definitive purpose and meaning.  You just have to do somethinking to figure it all out.  ********* 9 stars *********
There's a sign on The Lost Highway that says:*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*(but you already knew that, didn't you?)Since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie, I'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. If you have the DVD of MD, you can "cheat" by looking at David Lynch's "Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD" (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)First of all, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. Not often are the comments on the DVDs very accurate, but Vogue's "It gets inside your head and stays there" really hit the mark.David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great   acting (esp. Naomi Watts), a haunting soundtrack by Badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)Allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.Most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion/a dream sequence.Of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer. But for those expecting that, I urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;)MD is the story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn, a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations. Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged with Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.The movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they view it. There's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream.The main characters seen in the first half of the movie:Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the "dream-sequence" - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at Winkies. Notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'Diane'.Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then conveniently placed in Betty/Diane's aunt's luxurious home which Betty has been allowed to stay in.Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that Betty stays in. She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla. His sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty/Diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla's murder.Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks.The hitman: The person that murders Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go into every little detail (neither will I lay it out chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch' "hint-sheet".As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. I've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo.Only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. Since, as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it "Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines."Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and Diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla's part in the movie (from Adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.Gotta love that 'Something just bit me bad' line, though. :)The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. After a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.When reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. So, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. The bum also signifies Diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie.The Cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (Adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. Throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that she did bad. He is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch.During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is Camilla, but notice how she's assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home.In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. In her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita/Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place.When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy.The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is "She is the girl"; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla's photo resume.The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum.Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real. It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears.Anyway, that is my $0.02. Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.As usual, Lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.
I didn't understand this movie the first time I saw it although I liked the overall mood of it. But then I read an explanation of the movie somewhere (maybe here at IMDb) and it makes perfect sense. SPOILER AHEAD!!!!
After the opening credits with the swing dancers and up to the point where the guy in the cowboy hat says, "Hey pretty girl, time to wake up", you have been watching a DREAM that the main character is having. After she wakes up and the reality of her life is exposed we are shown--in a bit of a non-linear fashion--some of the recent events in her life (and the people involved) that served as material for the dream we have just watched. That's it.I thought that this was another "Lost Highway", a movie that I have never been able to make sense of, but "Mulholland Drive" turns out to be a lot more straightforward and accessible than it initially seems to be. Once I understood what I was watching I really enjoyed the movie and also appreciated the fact that it tells a very sad story. Don't give up on this movie.
'Mulholland Drive' resembles a detailed painting, one that is better understood with repeated viewing as more details are discovered. Though the story's straightforward, it unfolds its layers with each viewing. It resembles a beautiful dream/nightmare. The varied camera-work, the haunting score, the effective lighting and use of colour, the amazing art direction and special effects are all part of the stylish execution. The acting is overall excellent. Naomi Watts completely nails her part with a nuanced performance of a tormented character. Laura Elena Harring is sensational as the sensual Camilla. Justin Theroux and Ann Miller are superb in their strong parts.The story's not told in the conventional fashion. It starts off with a dream sequence (that comprises the entire first half). Every single character is relevant. Lynch leaves subtle hints for the viewer to put together. The dialogues set the tone (humorous or intense or horrifying) and add to the characters.The film starts off with a 60's dancing competition where a happy Diane and an elderly couple (her parents) are present. Later we are told that she won at a jitterbug competition before moving to L.A. This sequence is followed by a red bedcover and a red pillow. The camera zooms in on the pillow until it's black (marking the beginning of Diane's dream. The flashy words 'Mulholland Drive' appear on a signboard.This is what really happens: Diane Selwyn, an aspiring actress, moves to L.A. with the hope of getting recognized as 'a good actress and a star'. She fails to succeed and struggles with her career. At an audition she meets Camilla (Harring). They hit it off and through Camilla's help, Diane gets bit roles in her films. Selwyn falls in love with her. But, Diane isn't the only person in Camilla's life. There's also another woman and a man (a director). Diane is shattered when the director announces his engagement with Camilla. She hires a hit-man to kill Camilla but is tormented by guilt thereafter and loses herself in a dream where she sees a better version of things. But, even in this state she's reminded of her real self and it becomes purgatory. She ends up killing herself.The dream-sequence: Diane sees herself as Betty (the name was actually of a waitress she met at Winkies. She sees this waitress again in the dream but this time her name is Diane-a reminder of her real self). Here, Diane's a different person in contrast to her real self. Betty's more naive, vivacious, kind and successful. Her first audition is perfect. Not only will she win the part (as she's praised by everyone) but she is recommended to bigger producers. Yet, she's loyal to Camilla (as she rushes back home to help her).The car accident's Diane's wishful thinking that the hit didn't go through and Camilla lives but loses her memory as a result of which she becomes dependent on her and develops a new identity (a new desirable version of Camilla). Diane sees Camilla as her doll (Lynch's own reference). Camilla assumes the name of Rita (Rita Hayworth is the star Diane aspired to be like). Then there's Betty's Aunt's home. Wishful thinking perhaps that if Diane had a relative from the film fraternity, who helped her out and recommended her to directors, her career would have flourished? This fantasy home's a 'safe' haven for her and Camilla. This Aunt may have actually existed and Diane's real house belonged to her. Camilla finds money, the same money Diane paid the hit-man, in her purse. The money is returned to her as the hit's unsuccessful. The Winkies scene where a guy talks about his recurring nightmare of a scary-looking man outside Winkies, the man represents Diane's dark side.The director is quite a mess in Diane's dream (her way of punishing him). In the audition scene he stares at Diane. She is the object of his attraction (in reality he's smitten about Camilla and ignores Diane). Coco remains a strong figure. In reality, she looks down at Diane but in the dream, she's polite though she expresses her disapproval of Camilla (when in reality she disapproves Diane). The hit-man is sloppy (another part of Diane's wishful thinking?). The mysterious guy in the wheelchair takes control of the events in Diane's dream. The old couple could be Diane's parents and she probably had a terrible, maybe abusive, relationship with them as they torment her in the end scene. The fantasy couple are supportive strangers but once they get in the car their evil grin hints Diane's nightmarish purgatory. The cowboy's a clever touch by Lynch. He tells the director that if he does good, he'll appear once but if he does bad, he'll appear twice. Diane sees him twice because he was in the party (another reminder). The corpse in the house is Diane. The word 'Silencio' is repeated by Rita when she's at a state between wakefulness and sleep. The theatre play represents the nearing end of Diane's restless sleep. Betty's trembling signifies that she's about to wake up.The key and the blue box brings us to the reality in the movie. This box is held by the scary-man at the end. It may represent Camilla's protected life and her life is gone once it's unlocked. A more obvious symbolism's Pandora's box. It may represent Diane's purgatory. It could refer to the black box theory which states that the mind's fully understood once all's defined (except that this dark blue box suggests that not everything is clearly defined).I had a very different interpretation (which I won't mention) of this movie after first viewing (5 years ago). I revisited it yesterday, as I bought the special edition DVD and my first interpretation changed because the clues made better sense with this version. Perhaps, this too will change after subsequent viewing even though I'm quite satisfied with it now. What a movie, eh!
"Mulholland Dr." is something else. It is a film that will make you question your own sanity in many ways. Naomi Watts is the young, starry-eyed Canadian that wants to make it big in Hollywood. She is naive and thinks that dreams can come true if you want them bad enough. Watts discovers a very beautiful woman with amnesia (Laura Harring in a sizzling performance) in her aunt's house in L.A. and she becomes determined to help Harring out. Harring is mysterious and her near-fatal car crash occurred on the dark and winding Mulholland Dr. Throughout several oddball and very dark scenes take place. A young director (Justin Theroux) learns that Hollywood is run by strange underworld figures that are quiet, but ruthless. Another strange side-story is the mysterious man behind the diner that is seen in another character's dreams. An inept assassin also runs around causing unwanted trouble for himself and others. Then of course there are cameos by Robert Forster and Billy Ray Cyrus. The film twists into darkness as it progresses as Watts' and Harring's relationship turns sexual. A fine line between reality and fantasy is skewered and it comes down to a strange Pandora's box that holds the true secrets to "Mulholland Dr.". Oscar-nominated director David Lynch also shows that not all you see and hear is real, even though one's mind might think so. The film seems artificial at times, showing Hollywood as a nice place where dreams can come true. But then the dreams are turned into vivid nightmares of what could possibly be the true reality. David Lynch somehow makes this whole thing work and he makes it work beautifully in this reviewer's opinion. The film is a trumped-up version of "The Twilight Zone" and it adds many techniques that made Alfred Hitchcock the true master of suspense. Many wonder what this film is truly about. I am not sure. I am not sure Lynch even knows, but I am going to give it a shot. "Mulholland Dr." is the dark side of the human condition. It is a film that shows how easy one can lose one's soul if bad elements are let in. There are figures that seem somewhat supernatural to me in this movie. It seems that many of the characters are "messengers" that are all after one thing: Naomi Watts' soul. Watts lets the elements in and in the end she cannot overcome them. What she thinks she wants seems attractive on the outside, but there are cobras on the inside that will be too strong to fight off. In short, "Mulholland Dr." is a brilliant piece of film-making and it is brilliant due to its unique aspects and the fact that it is what one thinks it is. There is no right or wrong answer and it is a film that makes you think. "Mulholland Dr." is a complicated puzzle for the minds of cinema fanatics. 5 stars out of 5.
Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, "Mulholland Dr." was rejected. The next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. He did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.The film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita's lost her memory. She has no clue who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a "Gilda" poster in the bathroom. So the two set out to discover who Rita really is.David Lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. It's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. It's like a dream captured on film. By the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. Having watched the movie and then read an article on the Internet pointing out things in the film, I now understand the movie completely.The acting is very good. Watts is terrific. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. And the directing - hah! David Lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.Is this your type of film? Well, that depends. You should probably view more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true."Mulholland Dr." is a masterpiece. It's brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed. I love it.
Wow, what a strange film. It's a David Lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird. I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can't be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts' character.At any rate, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch's "Blue Velvet." There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it's very well scored.Like Lynch's "Twin Peaks" television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since Lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out TV series. When that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. That may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.I enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. It's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very intriguing movie.....just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.
Spoiler Alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain.'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his 'Twin Peaks' TV series. As Lynch enthusiasts know, his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology  with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure. All these elements are richly at work in 'Mulholland Drive,' making for a riveting, hair-raising, and highly satisfying film experience  especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole.The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film's opening scene, in which Harring's character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous, not to mention horrific, automobile accident. Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypal of Hollywood thoroughfares), she finds her way to the very apartment that Betty (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet from her 'Aunt Ruth,' a purportedly successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a new movie. As we later learn, Betty had herself arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest.A highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty's descent from the clichéd would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to remember her own name, the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (Actually, it turns out Aunt Ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a recollection of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like Steven's "man with the blue guitar" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases.
The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivaled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it.David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of films. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeper  it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a pay-off with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.
Mulholland Drive ( David Lynch, 2001), one of the most ambiguous films to be unleashed upon contemporary audiences, dare one say "abstract" even. In an era where simplicity is preferred over mystery and intrigue, the average audience member may find such a film angering in all respects. It resembles the classic noir genre, in so much that the infamous street Sunset Boulevard even appears in the movie as an ominous homage to the Billy Wilder film of the same name. Like that 1950 film, this movie's themes and tone is dark, but nowhere near as formulaic, per say. Classic film noir still relied on a certain pattern of events and character niches; the femme fatale, the unsuspecting victim most often our male protagonist and of course the incorruptible detective figure. This narrative method follows the invisible style, making it generally easy to understand. Mulholland Drive breaks many of these rules without a second glance, clarity being at the very bottom of its intentions if at all. Director David Lynch sets this in motion in a number of ways.The music by Angelo Badalamenti electronic yet menacing, and creates a mood of a near horror-film like aura.One of the most startling traits of Mulholland Drive is its complete disregard for the traditional Hollywood narrative style. Clarity, it ignores in throughout the movie, as new characters and plot lines are constantly introduced, some not followed up on till much later. The unity is leaves one even more bewilderment. Over an hour into the movie one still has no real idea how all these characters are connected, and certain events and objects even mean. The characters themselves are left to the willful imagination of the audience, as the story progresses it giving off the feeling of a mystery combined with pressing psychological puzzles. The goals of the many characters are very obscure, and the threatening world around them is even more mysterious. As for the style of the story telling, many of the house hold techniques are used: such as the foreshadowing when the ominous stranger, Louise Bonner, warns Naomi Watts of impending "danger". Closure is practically rhetorical in the film and in the same sense as Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001) most is left to the viewers to discern.In the same fashion as Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950), one of the focal points of the film appears to be the decadence of Hollywood. The overhead shots of the city are accompanied by surreal, nightmare like music. The top brass of the industry appear inhuman, pompous and over all intimidating. Note the low angle shot of the apparent executive Mr. Roque. We rarely seem, and when we do no other figure is allowed to be in his presence apparently. The portrayal of Hollywood has many homages to the way it was portrayed by Wilder; with the apartments being dirty looking with their drab browns and dirty to look everything. In the daylight scenes, where it can be hard to use low-key lighting without delving into the extreme-gloomy Tim Burton trademark, the cinematographer Peter Deming uses this filthy look to the setting to establish the dark mood. Another particularly hard-hitting aspect would be the loss of innocence. As Naomi Watts rehearses her role with "Rita" (Laura Harring), she delivers the dialogue in an overly-loud cliché manner, but in the rehearsal with the studio heads, she becomes a whole another person it seems. The medium shot of the first rehearsal is replaced in the second one with a sensuous medium close-up, and the excellence of her acting there is fueled by pure unrestrained sexuality. Compared to her naïve depiction up until this scene, one would struggle to connect the two scenes.This is just a small taste of the complex mystery world Lynch sets up in his cryptic film. Lighting, setting and the way the characters act still are saying something, but the way the plot moves makes it a struggling endeavor to understand. In all its zaniness, one important theme to grasp is the freedom of artistic tactics in film making. From the dawn of Hollywood to this day the general consensus is that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation. There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. The way the film is edited, credit to Mary Sweeney, plays an undeniable role in the film's perplexing beauty and terror to an extent.
Like most, I rented this after I heard the universal praise. And despite COUNTLESS bizarre, unexplainable moments along the way, I was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film. Then the two women went to the "performance" late at night. The rest of movie (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even WEIRDER than the first part AND completely contradict and dump on what I had already seen. Then the movie abruptly ends.Baffled, I wandered over to my computer to see if I could buy a clue as to what just happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a pretty clever guy. None of these other user comments made sense, even when they say "SPOILERS." I still have no idea what they're saying. Someone's dream? Not real? Then what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's "not real?" Or is it real? I'm forced to make a choice. Either:[a] The movie is a work of genius on a MENSA level and I'm simply too stupid to understand it. The movie is weird for weird's sake and just doesn't make sense. Everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they "get" it.I choose . Screw you guys, I'm going home...
Getting through David Lynch's catalogue and not all of his films have done it for me (or even been watchable for me). Mulholland Drive, though, was a mesmerising experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The fantastic third act revelations make rewatching it urgent!
I found Mulholldand Drive to be a fantastic film, having loved all of David Lynch's films seen personally so far (personal favourite being The Elephant Man, one of the most emotionally affecting films ever made) with the exception of Dune. For this viewer, Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best films and among the best films of the 2000s, but it is also one of Lynch's most love-it-or-hate-it films- from a love/hate him director- as seen in the reviews here. And it is very understandable why people would dislike it, it is weird (not unusual for Lynch), it is slow, the story mayn't be clear to some, the symbolism may go over people's heads and it does get confusing especially towards the end. And it has nothing to do with not getting it, it is just not for everybody's tastes and not everybody is going to connect with it. For those who love it neither of these are problems, admittedly it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style beforehand so that it doesn't come across as too much of a shock and also to watch it more than once. Justifying what was so great about Mulholland Drive, a good place to start would be the visuals, which are never less than scintillating with bold colours, symbolic imagery and some of the most striking cinematography of any film from this decade. The Silencio Club scene is so beautifully shot. The haunting retro score, thought-provoking dialogue and that it contains some of Lynch's finest direction and the best directing of all the films from 2001 are further things to like. The story is where those who dislike it are perplexed, granted there may be too many plot strands crammed in towards the end and not everybody's going to like how the ending is open to interpretation, but with me the thriller-drama story was gripping and I was captivated so much by the surrealist atmosphere, offbeat emotional intensity and sizzling suspense that the slow pacing didn't feel slow at all. It wisely focused on the relationship between Watts and Harring, and while bizarre it was very well handled. The cast carry the film brilliantly, especially with the sensational lead performance of Naomi Watts who has never been better than here. Laura Harring is enchanting and Justin Theroux is very good. In conclusion, while not for everybody's tastes for understandable (and quite obvious) reasons Mulholland Drive was fantastic in all areas. 10/10 Bethany Cox
"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been two of my favourite pieces of film-making, and even though past films by lynch have been slightly disappointing for me they have always been worth watching a number of times.  to be pretentious, lynch can be like a good wine - he must be savoured and mulled over.  but in the end you must make up your own mind about what you have seen, for lynch never gives you the full answers.many people will walk out of "mulholland drive" possibly wanting to throttle themselves over the mind-bending visual jigsaw puzzle that has just unfolded before them.  but there is a twisted logic to this film, you just have to look for the clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in hollywood, doe-eyed and in search of stardom.  she then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom who has escaped from an attempted murder on mulholland drive. together they try to uncover the secrets behind the amnesiac's life.  this all leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal all. and that is when the film throws everything out the window.  people we thought we knew are entirely different people altogether... is it a dream?  a reminiscence about life's previous escapades? you will either love this film or hate it.  david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers.  but as his universe itself is always about extremes, it is fitting that his films provoke such reactions.It is best to look at this film thematically, rather than as a straight-forward narrative.  and appreciate the fact that lynch is a film-maker who will still let you draw your own conclusions.  he has had many imitators as of late, particularly in "vanilla sky", where a mind-bending film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes, and you will probably forget about that film as soon as you walk out of the cinema. mulholland drive will haunt you.
A lot of people say that 'Rosebud' is the greatest mystery from Hollywood, but actually I think that Mulholland Drive is. I've never experienced anything quite like it. Its plot is slow-moving and sometimes feels unconnected to anything, yet it's too engrossing to look away. Mulholland Drive is one of the most intriguing films I've ever had the pleasure to watch and it's one that demands viewing multiple times. It's that type of film where you think that everything will be explained to you at the end (like The Skin I Live In) however, being a David Lynch film, this doesn't happen and the film is all the better for it.Once the film had finished I hadn't a clue what I'd just watched, yet I couldn't wait to get onto that wonderful thing called Google and find the answers! The ten clues in the DVD also did not help one bit! It forces you to analyse everything and makes you realise what an astonishingly clever many David Lynch is. Every scene has a purpose, it just requires strong thought which is why a lot of people would instantly disregard this film as meaningless rubbish. However, if you dig deeper you may find yourself in awe at one of the most intricate plots ever established.I loved the whole metaphor for the Hollywood dream being a lie. Words can't describe how clever this film is. Any film that has a whole website dedicated to a whole range of crack-pot explanations is surely a masterpiece, and I truly believe that Mulholland Drive is. It stops becoming a film and turns into art. An extremely interesting and involving art-piece that I found myself being sucked into. The mystery is just captivating, with various scenes that seem like they've just been shoved in like the hit-man scene (which is hilarious) yet you can't stop watching it! It's very difficult to put into words.Reading various explanations only makes me appreciate this film more, and the amount of thought and care that has gone into it. Naomi Watts puts on a brilliant performance and I found myself completely captivated by her story. There are scenes that seem to go on for such a long time, such as the remarkable audition scene, however it's scenes like this which give Mulholland Drive such a dream-like atmosphere and pulls you into the story even deeper. The club Silencio goes on for an awful long time, yet I wasn't bored, just astonished at the film's atmosphere. There's something about it.Of course the film is fabulously directed and I can see myself becoming more of a fan of David Lynch now that I've seen the brilliant Elephant Man and the good but flawed Wild at Heart. He's certainly very unique and this film is unlike any other I've seen before. It's a film that will make you perplexed but also gripped. At a hefty two and a half hours long I was never bored and just wanted to see it all again! Mulholland Drive really is a masterpiece that will get your mind boggling like a boggle champ. It's incredibly haunting with bizarre imagery that is sure to always find a place wedged in your mind. It's one of those films that stays with you, and you don't really want it to leave either.
As is often the case with a movie I don't understand upon an initial viewing, I head on over to the FAQ page for the film here on IMDb and read what's available to see if there's any kind of analysis or explanation of what happened. That would be an excellent start for anyone curious about this movie. But then, upon a second viewing of this picture the very next day, events in the film, both the dream sequences and reality became much clearer. Not only that, but the way the story was plotted and presented was proven to be downright exceptional. I think "Mullholland Drive" is a mind bending spellbinder that you won't forget long after you've seen it, no matter whether you loved it or hated it.We get any number of hints in the story that things are not quite what they seem through various scenes and lines of dialog that in retrospect are cleverly placed. I'm going to call Betty/Diane (Naomi Watts) and Rita/Camilla (Laura Harring) by their names implied in the various situations I mention in order to keep things sensible. Recall when Betty asks the stranger taking a shower in her aunt's apartment what her name is. She can't remember, and then gazes thoughtfully at a screen poster of the movie "Gilda". The woman takes the name of it's star, Rita Hayworth, but more significantly, the poster's tag line states "There NEVER WAS a woman like Gilda". Just like there never was a woman called 'Rita'. Immediately following, Betty relates to Rita how happy she is to be in Hollywood and in her aunt's expensive apartment, and says "...and now I'm in this dream place". When Betty tries to convince Rita that they should follow up on Rita's thought that her real name might be Diane, Betty suggests that they investigate in an undercover fashion - "We'll pretend to be someone else".Though it may require a complete leap of faith, one needs to consider that the movie's story actually begins when Diane, now on the movie set of the 'Sylvia North Story' as a spectator, sees Camilla kissing director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), who's showing her and her co-star how to do the scene. It's at this point when Diane begins to understand that her real life relationship with Camilla is coming to an end and she doesn't like it. Though it seems drastic, Diane hires a hit-man to kill her former lover with the words "This is the girl", which ironically were the same words used by Adam to hire Camilla in the first place while under duress from the Castigliane Brothers and more directly, from the weirdly threatening 'Cowboy' (Monty Montgomery).Then there are the entire scenarios involving the blue box and it's key, and the interlude at the Silencio. The narrator at the Silencio repeatedly assures his audience that what they see and hear are illusions. With the Betty/Rita, or Diane/Camilla relationship about to hit the rocks, I thought it quite fitting that the Spanish singer offered a rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' (Over You). That was a very nice touch.There's actually a whole lot more I could probably comment on, but then it would get tedious for the reader, so I'll finish things up by saying that you ought to give this film a try with an open mind, and even be prepared to get confused because the non-linear exposition of events can be troublesome. And on top of that, things are made even more complicated by the random dream events. But for the patient, I think this is a masterful film that deserves one's attentive consideration.
I would love to write an intelligent, detailed analysis of Mulholland Drive, I really would, but since I haven't got the slightest idea of director David Lynch's intent (other than to completely confound the viewer), I'm going to have to pass. Instead, let me tell you how my week has been so farMonday: Work as usual. Was involved in an RTA on the way home (not my fault—an old lady drove into the side of my car). Rang insurance company. Started to watch Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Tuesday: Dog ate a packet of ibuprofen and had to be rushed to the vets (no idea how he got them—suspect the cats were involved). Went to work. Came home. Visited the in-laws. Resumed watching Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Wednesday: After the two previous days, this one was fairly uneventful. Dog came home, hopefully without any lasting problems. Ended the day by watching a bit more of Mulholland Drive. Perked up for the lesbian sex scene between Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, but fell asleep soon after.Thursday: Car collected by body shop. Went to work in wife's car (being extra careful to avoid elderly drivers). Watched the rest of Mulholland Drive (managed to stay awake, largely in hope that Watts might indulge in some more sapphic shenanigans, but she doesn't).4/10 for the sexy scene, reduced to 1/10 for the self-indulgent, pretentious, and utterly pointless surreality of the whole thing, especially the opening dance number, the incomprehensible club scene in which a woman mimes a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's classic 'Crying' before fainting (???), the weird hobo with the strange box, and the bit where two miniature people crawl out of a handbag and sneak under a door.
With an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes's Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dream, myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit-part Hollywood actress/waitress, Diane Selwyn, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to hotshot director Adam Kesher.The film effectively takes place in Diane's drug-fueled head; we are witness to her crazy distortions, her wish-fulfillments, regrets, obsessions and fears. Using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively entangles them. The last 45 minutes are as dream-like as what came before; and the troublesome air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams.Lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new, but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. Yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds - an element that was missing in all of his other films except the Straight Story. He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a wholesome Canadian farm girl destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue-lady? What does she signify? Who is the bum behind Winkies? What is the significance of the rotting corpse at Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential take on the film's status as fiction? Lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses, choosing instead to present his "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs.The acting is top rate, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn/Betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance. Laura Harring has the requisite Hayworthesque allure as Camilla/Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role. It was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an Academy Award.This is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely. The mystery at the heart of the film remains in Lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents. Upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence. Ultimately, this is Lynch's key film.
It´s a joke, right?! Lynch could not get produced this as a TV show. He was out of money, so what to do? Well, he received somehow some Dollars and "completed" the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together... How can anybody see a failed pilot for TV as an cinematic masterpiece?!And now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning!? Well, wake up, there is none! Like in that other TV series by Lynch, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build up a mystery and then come up with nothing. I guess Lynch will repeat this concept until people will realise, the emperor has no clothes. In Germany there is a comedian called Harpe Kerkerling. He dressed up as an opera singer and "performed" some new "art songs". Singing complete nonsense like this: "The wolf. The lamb. On the meadow. Hurrz!" It´s a classic now. Anyway, afterwards he discussed it with the audience. And they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship.You people giving this movie a rating of 8.0 in imdb.com, you people could be one of them. So let´s say it all together: "Hurrz!"0/10 Macaulay J. Connor
"There is no band. It is all a tape recording." – Mulholland DriveBaudrillard writes of the three historical orders of appearance, where images and signs change their relationships to reality in western culture. He calls these the 1st, 2nd and 3rd order simulacrums.The 1st order simulacra took place between the Renaissance and Industrial Revolution. This was the counterfeit period, where signs reflected and then perverted a basic reality, art essentially imitating life. The 2nd order simulacra took place during the Industrial age. This was a period of mass reproduction. Signs were mass-produced and began to signify themselves as symbols of money and power. They marked the absence of a basic reality and gradually began to bear less relation to their origins. The 3rd order simulacra is our current phase. Signs now bear no relationship to any reality. Reality has disintegrated, signs now having no meaning whatsoever due to a liquidation of referentials.Films like "The Truman Show", "Dark City" and "The Matrix" remain locked at the level of the first order of simulacra, naively believing that there exists a "real world" behind the simulation. In contrast, films like "Existenz", "Eyes Wide Shut", "A History of Violence" and "Mulholland Drive" are acutely aware that we no longer live in the age of spectacle. Spectacle subjected us to images, now we ourselves become participatory images.Most view "Mulholland Drive" as being cleanly divided into two halves: the first half being a young actress's fantasy, the second half being the dark reality of both Hollywood and herself. But look closely and "Mulholland Drive's" fantasy is always positioned on the same level as its reality. What Lynch is intuitively recognising is that reality is already hyper-real, always somebody else's dreams and desires. There is now no meaningful distinction between the two; between The City of Dreams and our desires, fantasy and cyberspace states.In this regard, "Mulholland Drive" shares much with Kubrick's "Eyes Wide shut", both films being fairly accurate depictions of Lacanian Desire (ie Desire=Lack=Real, and it is only in the dream that we come close to a real awakening), the difference being that Kubrick uses the "logic" of "interrupted dreams" (constant interruptions, telephone calls, narrative short-circuiting etc), whilst "Mulholland Drive" is entirely constructed in the "language of dreams". Lynch's film is a free-floating anxiety dream, with constant temporal collapses and radically changing identities, whilst Kubrick's is more architectural and formal.Both films also utilize fractured narratives, fantasy logic and generate an extreme sense of mystery, confusion and horror (ironically, in attentive viewers), which provokes an investigative impulse, their audiences forced to apply a rational or analytic approach for purposes of coherently re-integrating the puzzling narratives, whether in order to re-assert control over the anxiety that the films provoke, or worse, to finally safely dismiss it all as exclusively a "dream".But the comparisons don't end there. Both films also have a sequence which serves to "demystify" the audience and dreamer. In Kubrick's film, Sydney Pollack, over a pool table, attempts to bring Tom Cruise "up to date" with reality, telling him that it was "all a performance" and "staged just for him". Likewise, The Real of Lynch's film is not Naomi Watt's supposedly waking world, but the shadowy "movie house" of Club Silencio. It is in Club Silencio that Lynch has a magician demonstrate that his "singers" are all lip syncing to a "pre recorded soundtrack", a "performance deliberately staged" for their audience. The representation is always accepted as real, even when the audience has been demystified. And there is another "Mulholland" theme that has significant resonance with "Eyes": the forever elusive patriarchal powers in a capitalist society. A line repeated throughout the film by powerful people is "THIS IS THE GIRL!", its significance changing with each utterance. Like Kubrick, Lynch paints a deeply disturbing portrait of women in the hands of and at the mercy of, unscrupulous patriarchy (as well as its also dis-empowering effects on men).So both directors position their stories - Kubrick's part-dream-fable of repressed marital infidelity and Lynch's dream-fable of doomed lesbian love - within a representation of society as a closed hierarchical, authoritarian system in which the ultimate source of power remains forever hidden behind a series of ominous representatives. But it is Club Silencio that makes "Mulholland Drive" interesting. Writing of the Club, Kpunk says "There is nothing less misleading in cinema's history of illusion than Lynch's scene in Club Silencio. What we are seeing and hearing - the film itself - is a recording and nothing but. On the most banal level, this is the Real which the magic of cinema must conceal. Yet the scene haunts for reasons other than this. It challenges us to recognize that our own lives, the roles we perform (as people, as actors), are themselves recordings, scripted by forces outside the self and whose "substance" turns out to be itself nothing more than a mass of influences."In the end, "Mulholland Drive" is not only a story about a few characters' lost sense of Self but about the fractured identity of Hollywood. Memories of Hollywood (and our culturally overloaded postmodern world) are stored in a massive array of film footage, newspapers, images, memories, books, revivals, reconstructions and remakes. The language of "Mulholland Drive" thrives on this meta-language. This postmodern pastiche of signs and references turns the film itself into a simulated narrative of sorts. We are able to immerse ourselves in the film precisely because of our brains, the simulacrum existing in our minds as much as it does in Hollywood, the place were such minds meet and melt. And the only escape from the tyranny of eternal performance - from the white noise of sights and sounds - comes in fulfilment of "Mulholland Drive's" final utterance: Silencio .9/10 – After the abrasive "Wild at Heart", Lynch reestablished himself as a master director with both "Straight Story" and "Mulholland Drive".
David Lynch has an instantly recognizable style with his ambiguous extreme close-up shots, deep and rich colors and slow, dream-like dialog. Mulholland Drive uses these to great effect and has a good story to boot. The film will leave you asking many questions, or just baffled beyond words, but if you re-watch it, look for the right clues and have a decent understanding of symbolism and storytelling techniques, it's possible to decipher the meaning of the film. (Though I didn't -- I just checked online what other people thought.)Mulholland Drive features amazing performances by all of its actors, but most of all Naomi Watts in the double lead role (kind of.) She shows such a great variety of emotions it's hard to believe they come from the same person.The film is at times frighteningly scary, and it has a habit of turning to weird and dark places very suddenly. But it also has a great sense of humor. The dialog is witty and the scenes loaded with irony and self-parody.
This is a work of such outstanding genius and of such subtle nuance and complexity, that a brief review cannot possibly do it justice. In this film, writer and director David Lynch restrains himself from being too gross and disgusting and manages to concentrate instead wholly on just telling this gut-wrenching tragic tale in its fullness, to the exclusion of his usual self-indulgent follies and distractions. (The many bizarre 'Lynch touches' found throughout this film are kept within bounds, so that they all work and are effective.) I have just seen the film for the fourth time, and it gets better every time, and definitely improves with (either its or one's own) age. There are many fans of this film, and there is a website I recommend, which is www.mulholland-drive.net/studies where many answers to enigmas in the film are to be found. For instance, the house at 6980 Mulholland Drive towards which 'Rita' is being driven in the limousine at the opening of the film is really at 6980 Macapa Drive, whereas 6980 Mulholland Drive is apparently an unoccupied spot directly below the Hollywood sign above Mulholland Drive, which is a long road which goes up towards the Santa Monica Hills and is an address of many famous movie stars past and present. The Hollywood sign on the hills features prominently in the film, and is of the essence of the tale. It is wonderful to see two old-timers and shameless scene-stealers in this film, namely Lee Grant and Ann Miller (it was her last film appearance, not long before she died). The moody and hauntingly effective music for the film is by Angelo Badalamenti, who has worked with Lynch on most of his films and on TWIN PEAKS. Badalamenti appears in the film as one of the two Mafia brothers who spits out his espresso coffee and keeps saying 'This is the girl.' (He does not speak in chords or octaves, however, but has a human voice.) The film is remarkable for the stunning, brilliant, and Oscar-worthy performances of the two leading players, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring (her strange surname was originally Herring, which is a respectable English surname, and why she changed it I cannot imagine). Every frame of this film is totally mesmerizing. I do not know how Lynch manages to make every shot so full of mystery and menace, and although a lot of it is down to brilliant editing, the only real answer can lie in saying simply: 'That's a genius at work.' If only he were less unruly in some of his other films, or had somebody to restrain him from his excesses! Geniuses are naughty boys and need to be restrained by Nanny or they run out of control and make a botch of their work. But in this film, he kept down his wilder urges and just made the film work. The famous French producer Alain Sarde had the good sense to back this film, which was languishing unappreciated as a script in America and was misunderstood. It really is more of a European film, despite the intensity of its locale and its deep roots in that specific and uniquely American fantasy world of Hollywood. The film is dedicated at the end to Jennifer Symes (1979-2008), who was apparently an aspiring young actress similar to the character played by Naomi Watts in this film, though that is not information which I have verified, and is just from the internet. The beginning of the film shows Naomi Watts ('Betsy') emerging all fresh-faced and breathless from Los Angeles Airport, an ecstatic expression of excitement and anticipation on her face at arriving in Hollywood, where she hopes to become a star but will settle for being just a famous actress. She takes a taxi to an apartment which belongs to her aunt, who has gone to work on a film on location so that Betsy can stay there for a while. The address given in the film is 1612 Havenhurst, but that does not exist, as Havenhurst ends at 1500. The real address of this truly extraordinary art-deco apartment is I1 Borghese, 450 Sycamore Avenue, for those who want to drop in for tea with the aunt. (Why not? Hollywood is where fantasy is reality, isn't it?) Watts and Harring are totally spellbinding in their performances and in their relationship with each other, which becomes very physical and just about as intense as they get, not to say obsessional. There are electrifying scenes with both Melissa George as Camilla Rhodes and Michele Hicks as Nicki Pelazza. Both of them do wonderful sixties songs, as auditions. And there is a spine-tingling and magnificent rendering of Roy Orbison's song 'Crying' in Spanish by Rebekah Del Rio which Lynch films in full. One of the endearing traits of the naughty little boy Lynch is his love of sixties music. It seems that a jitterbug contest in Canada was cut from the beginning of the film. 'Betsy' is supposed to have won it, so what a shame we did not get to see it. Possibly there was pressure from the producer about the length, as the film is two hours and 20 minutes long, and in some versions as long as two hours and 27 or variously 28 minutes (I suspect a minute of the sex scene may have been cut). I wonder if there will ever be a director's cut, or perhaps this is it. David Lynch carries on the noble tradition of French surrealism in his films, whether he knows it or not. Every screen minute of this film is in an alternative reality, even when the camera stares at mundane things like a plate of uneaten fried eggs at Winkie's on Sunset Boulevard. Sometimes I could imagine that André Breton and Philippe Soupault secretly contribute to his scripts through a medium and devise some of the eerie, supernatural, and reality-piercing scenes.
...and, unfortunately, kind of boring.Somehow Lynch managed to make a work of both absurdist comedy and surrealist horror in just three minutes and it wasn't all too interesting for a majority of its running time. Of course, it was still at least partially interesting and the visual it feeds the viewer is really unique and hard to describe accurately with adjectives. The whole short has this bizarre feeling that's so uncomfortable and unsettling I'm quite impressed (which is why this otherwise overly slow short mustered up a 6/10 from me); of course, what else could I expect from Lynch, even at his most minor and, frankly, amateurish?
What does this movie mean. Two cartoons(looks like gloves) are screaming continously for 3 minutes . Yeah, that's all . The whole feeling was unpleasant and frustrating . It can not be explained in words.My only question is- why someone would make such a film?
Having gone through most of his short film "creations", I have a strong suspicion that this format isn't really for Lynch. Creativity without control, idea without meaning, aesthetics without content. There are several interpretations of Lynch in my head, the most favorable of which he is a holy lunatic (I would rather not elaborate on the rest, given the rules of the IMDb...) who vomits his incoherent visions with schizophrenic unfilterity. In the absence of guidance, the vast majority of these works are worthless and unenjoyable. Unfortunately, this piece also falls into this category.
This is a very intriguing short movie by David Lynch, and saying the name David Lynch is probably enough for a lot of people. This is your typical Lynch short. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde has been crying, the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde, and that's about it.With a lot of silent moments, but with the haunting music from Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. This short feels a little like 'Mulholland Dr.', a movie I loved, and therefore I liked this one as well. It is probably especially for Lynch fans but there is a chance you like this.
David Lynch's new short is a very "Lynchian" piece, full of darkness, tension, silences, discreet but very textured background music, and features again two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurrent theme in his work.Both characters create a very intriguing slave-mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in Mulholland Dr.Beautiful. For Lynch fan's.
Darkened Room is a short film from David Lynch's digital video phase. It starts with an Asian girl who refers ambiguously to a troubled friend, who we then cut to. She is a visibly upset blonde woman alone in room on a sofa whose face is streaked by mascara from her tears. Later a third woman enters and verbally torments her.This is a technically raw short film which brought me to mind the look and feel of Lynch's last feature film Inland Empire (2006), a film I have mixed feelings about. With that film, Lynch moved away from the gorgeous visual aesthetic he had hitherto been associated with. The change was mainly down to the move from film to digital video, which looks a lot uglier. The sound in this one is pretty amateurish as well, with the hum of the video camera audible at times. There is still an unmistakable Lynch feel to proceedings though with uncomfortably long pauses where little happens, a mysterious situation that is never fully explained (to say the least) and an ominous low soundtrack maintaining a certain feeling of dread. Lynch does generate an interesting tone to a certain extent but the short run-time never allows him to develop the material into anything very engaging, while it's also a little too lo-fi for its own good as well.
What experimental follies David Lynch loves to go into. And, of course, that's the prerogative of any artist with access to the equipment that Lynch has, and as part of how he goes about using the digital medium to put out ideas he wouldn't of had expressed out for everyone to see years ago. This one, however, shows what good and not so good qualities can come with the mental floodgates let open and with little cohesion. Darkened Room, which like Rabbits may have some connection to Lynch's magnum opus Inland Empire, has three parts to it, with the first two actually not bad at all really. The first, which is very random and hilarious in the vein of the director's absurd idiosyncrasies, shows a Japanese woman in her Tokyo apartment spouting off statistics about bananas, in a weird audio voice. Then, by way of the Japanese woman's 'friend', we move on to the darkened room of the title, where a blond girl sits, mascara smeared on her face, sobbing about something that no matter what she says in-between her cries, doesn't make sense. It doesn't matter too much, in this instance at least, that we don't know exactly why she's crying or how long she's been in the darkened room. The amount of emotional connection that can be felt though, and the subtext behind the words, make it something sort of special.But then comes that last part, which feels MUCH longer than the other two parts combined, where another woman- another friend of the blonde girl- comes in and just talks and talks about something or this or that, and suddenly, like with a snip with a pair of scissors, the emotional connection is snapped, and what we're left with is Lynch's pretentious ramblings feed through and out of this other actress's mouth. In fact, this last part is one of the worst things I've ever seen from Lynch, as it committed something that I don't like seeing from the director much at all- as it doesn't happen too often for me at any rate- which is that it's dull and weird for the sake of it. Nothing gets resolved, and the end is just a 'huh' that isn't a satisfying one in the slightest. I was left with some good memories of Darkened Room, and some very bad ones too. In a sense it's Lynch working stuff out, via digital video and access on his website, and it'll either appeal to some sense or not. For me, it was both.
I'm not gonna lie, I am obsessed with David Lynch. My favorite movie of all time is his 1977 film, Eraserhead and close behind that is Elephantman, and Mulholland Drive. I also loved Lost Highway, Twin Peaks, and Blue Velvet. I however haven't been as pleased with his stuff after Mulholland Drive. I thought Inland Empire was a mess and a huge disappointment. This would bring me to Darkened Room. A film that ties into Inland Empire quite a bit but has the same pointless feel as that film. I guess I just have no idea what's going on so I didn't a point in filming it. I did like how it was shot though. It had a very low budget, independent feel and that is very inspiring to me as a young filmmaker. I'm making it a goal to see all of David Lynch's films but this one was a disappointment.
I finally got to have a look at this experimental Lynch short after waiting for so long....and unfortunately, it wasn't worth it! Even for a die hard Lynch fan, I found this to be really tedious....nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful pauses where nothing happens, long, monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing, or caring, what the hell it was all about, what happened before and what happened afterward. There was a Mulholland Drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita -esque, and a Lost Highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly. Unfortunately, It's all very uninteresting and very dull, nothing happens, it's very forgettable and I think i will delete it from my computer and forget I ever watched it. Sorry David!
when I watched this movie the first time I found myself drifting along the screen looking for little hints such as the puppet and missed out on the dialogue completely. The second time I was certain that the girl was pregnant and not allowed back in her old life which is why she claim`s to be left out although sitting inside a room. The puppet  is a visual hint that the crying girl has just learned about her new baby boy and her step-mom or sis or even young mom doesn`t seem to be supporting her very well. For a half-a-day production this is a nice little picture that lynch painted, however maybe i was just being dumb but i missed the in-depth a little bit, hence i`ll watch again and again because we know what kind of books lynch reads ... there`s gotta be something out there. who likes lynch likes dali so why not check out the artwork there is ...
I am a huge fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a quite disappointing experience. Apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that I've come to associate with Lynch's work. The visuals are dull, to say the least, and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest.This feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera-work, scenery, sound and script. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities. I feel as though I'm watching one of Davids home videos, produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
Actually spelled "Darkend Room" this is an intriguing but quickly forgettable Lynch piece.  Lynch does the camera work himself, and the digital video look has a kind of odd appeal.  This is hidden on DavidLynch.com and true Lynch fans should seek it out.  I'm a huge fan, but I've been uninspired by this and most of the original work on Lynch's site. I'm hoping there will be more rewarding surprises than this in the near future.  These two young women are extremely attractive, though.
It's a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but it got all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It's mysterious, dark, inconclusive, eerie, and strange; and before the blond girl starts to talk it's even a bit scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also sinister and mysterious About the setting itself, it hasn't the "traditional" red curtains, but it has socking purple painted walls, which give it an equally effect of eeriness.The plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying she's there just because of her fault We don't know what did happen or what will happen next it ended unsolved and puzzling, as a good Lynch movie must end! It's a great short, despite some amateurish acting. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could have been better in this short.
I don't quite know how to explain "Darkend Room," because to summarize it wouldn't really do it justice.  It's a quintessentially Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation.  I would say this short is definitely more on the  "Mulholland Drive" end of the Lynchian spectrum, as opposed to "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story."  It's hidden on Lynch's website, and well worth the search.
Just saw "darkend room" and was very disappointed. Like other users here, i'm a huge lynch fan but this film really ISN'T it!It's strange, right. it contains lynchian themes like a blond and brunette, a dark mysterious event taking place but we don't know what it is, great moody soundtrack, and of course hints that hide in the picture and all you have to do is to clinch them together to get the complete picture.However, this movie, although containing all these ingredients, is a disappointment not only to lynch fans, but anyone who likes short and artistic films. I sense that lynch himself maybe was surprised with the result, but there was little he could do to fix it. the camera work is not interesting at all and the entire situation looks as if lynch and the actresses are actually rehearsing a scene to be filmed later to the real film. many student films, good and bad, are shot like that, and it seems that lynch, doing the camera work himself, was trying to learn along the way the benefits of using DV instead of 35 mm film.Unfortunately, all I have to say is that you should'nt play with your audience. learn the technique first and then make the film, don't do it at the same time.The interesting point in the film is that it might be connected, thematicaly, to another short film called "Rabbits". just a few days ago I read this great theory that the mystery in rabbits might be connected to the scene depicted in darkend room. for those who seen rabbits and try to understand what is it about, this is an intriguing idea.But to those who didn't see rabbits and don't what i'm talking about, "Darkend room" is a short film that is unimportant and not really interesting. it's like someone else tried to follow the footsteps of the master lynch, but failed to do so. Lynch doing Lynch and not getting anywhere...
I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one. First of all, I find this short-film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher. One other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on. No-one else could have done that better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Sure, I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side, will find themselves disappointed. And in good right. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one that helped make Lost Highway/Mulholland Dr. is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else, will just not get what this is all about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about messing with your animal-core, your instinctual self, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) by which you instinctively react. It's not about pleasure of any kind, it's about getting the desired reaction out of you. And, that, my friend, is pure art.
Wow, I love and respect pretty much anything that David Lynch has done. However, this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video. To give you a couple of examples: 1. David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, however, this had little visual artistic content (blank walls, "up shots" with ceiling in the background) 2. David Lynch typically takes great pride in audio, however, in this you could even hear the video camera's hum. In fact, it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie. unless......this is a joke, on David's part, to force fans search his website (for hours) only to find this drivel. I hope so, because at least that idea is funny.
Hello, this little film is interesting especially for an artist, film-maker or music creator or a visual artist, for:One can feel and examine David's touch/style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity.You can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots, the pans and the sound elements. Even as simple film, this creation is multy-layer. For example, there are some sounds that drone all along, while others appear (though subtle), at certain points to support certain shots.One can see also several types of pans: some go up and down in a gentle back-forth way. There is diagonal pan. Zooms also go back and forth sometimes.The lightning and the composition/disposition of elements in the space is, as usual and obviously, work of a painer/artist. This can be felt even in this crappy room. This is to say: one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look/view and composing the scene. Then comes the forcelines of the visuals: like digonales, parallels, etc. The light's degradées and the colours, although without too much research for textures as in big productions, are fine too. This is an artist's sketch of a sort...All this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the David's touch/feel to it, as with any true artist.
Admittedly, I thought the first half was pretty decent. The cuts from back and forth from the Asian actress to the little girl on the sofa were quite intimidating and created a nice scary atmosphere and when we see the camera closer on the puppet and little girl and how she's shaking from what happened, it almost elevated the film into "good"-territory. What happens afterward is pretty disappointing though.The moment the blonde girl opens her mouth the first time is when it all goes south. She keeps asking questions into the empty room which is not completely bad, but could have been handled in a more interesting fashion. When the other girl enters the room and starts throwing phrases at the little blonde girl, however, it's getting almost amateurish and I certainly wouldn't have though David Lynch was behind this hadn't I known already in advance. It's still unclear what exactly is/was going on, but it also seems to be going absolutely nowhere at this point. The director's recent work has been kinda uninspiring for a while now. I hope, with his 70th birthday approaching, he finally manages to turn things round once more.
I love all his work but this looks like nothing.. sorry.. This looks more like a "David Lynch copycat". I think people like it only because "it's from David Lynch".
This surreal, short piece of avant garde video art is among David Lynch's lesser works, but that doesn't mean that fans of his cannot get anything out of it. I found it to be highly fascinating in nature, especially due to its cryptic and enigmatic style, one that is certainly Lynchian in every conceivable way. One may consider the early, bizarre scenes featuring an Asian woman discussing bananas to be entirely unrelated to the later, horror-movie type scenes featuring a young woman that seems to be...captured (her situation is never exactly revealed, which makes it all the more haunting) to be entirely disconnected, but the link between these two pars is among the weirdest and most interesting features of this ten minute mystery. Perhaps none of it means anything, but even if it didn't it's still a genuinely scary and surrealist experiment that combines absurdist humor with inexplicable Lynchian madness.
This is almost typical Lynch. However, What makes this film slightly unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. But i believe Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments.However, a lot of Typical Lynch motifs are present, such as: floating camera work; haunting music; long (excruciating) pauses; hanging curtains; dim lights growing darker at a slow (almost indiscernible) pace; extreme close ups; themes of women in trouble; over-bearing, incompassionate, all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught, temporarily oblivious, in the dark and so on...The performances are great and the short is thought provoking. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation. Many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination.Another brilliant effort from Lynch. I only hope he makes some shorts, more along the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials. They were inspired.
...but this just isn't working and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what grounds? There are some loose hints here and there, but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet, are very playful when doing that. There is some visual sense, there are some subplots, characters, ideas etc. But this is dull and yes, pointless. Because whatever there is to explore is either to "small", either too far-fetched, or simply told before in a superior manner. It's just Lynch exploring DV, nothing more so it should be treated like this. 1/10
You really have to watch Lynch movies more then once(maybe twice). Also you have to think and search a little bit to understand his movies.I think this film is about a girl, who is dead, and now she is in purgatory to learn what was happened to her. She doesn't know what is going on and she is stuck in nowhere.I think, she and her boyfriends, we see at the door, had a car accident or something, and both are dead. She doesn't remember and looking for her boyfriend. But an angel(second girl) comes and make her remember that she is dead. At the end she remembers and cries.About who she died: She didn't have any accident. Something happened to boy or her. And the puppet refers to to boy.It is really freaky film if you think that way.
It's hard to believe David Lynch isn't trolling. Such a product would be acceptable from a 6-year-old who is using video editing software for the first time, we could end up with an insincere half-smile, or even put it on the fridge, but from someone who has been making movies for 53 years, such a job is worth an insult. And please don't even try a nonsense explanation that it is experimental, metaphorical, or artistic. The fact that something comes out of the hands of a recognized creator will not automatically makes that thing valuable. Unfortunately we know all too well that snobbery is an enormous force, but it is not this powerful...
The short film feels like an experiment in animation. Lynch seems to explore what he can do with the medium in the same was he did with early comsumer DV cameras. It has the beauty, playfulness and possible potential of a child's drawings.
A slow, stylish, eerie and extremely interesting story set "in a city deluged by constant rain where three rabbits live with a constant mystery". Mr Lynch has a great talent for establishing atmosphere and this series is soaked with his trademark (weird) mood. When I watched the first episode I was not sure whether to laugh or be baffled at what I was seeing. 3 Rabbits talk out of sequence, an unseen audience claps whenever one of them enters the room and laughs (not because something funny is said, but at the misery of the rabbits), a candle burns in the corner, a demon face chants something undecipherable (reminds me of the litanies of Satan, the camera seems to be disturbed in the beginning of the 7 out of 8 episodes by something I can only guess to be a spirit. We hear footsteps, the door sometimes opens and the phone even rings. All to the frustration of the rabbits. I noticed a lot of people have tried to figure out what Rabbits is about and my take on it is pretty simple. Firstly, this wasn't the first time I have seen something like this, though this is definitely very well made. I read a book a very long time ago whose title I cannot remember about 2 kids who were put in a scenario similar to this rabbit house and were observed everyday by their captures. The 2 children (I only remember one child called Mavis) were unaware they were being watched and as far as they knew, they had a normal life (went out, watched TV etc) except they didn't in real life. Everything was in their mind. This seems similar to this story. The rabbits could be 'prisoners' who are being observed or kept by someone (the man in the green suit). There is however how they react to the audience (whenever they enter the room and the audience claps, they wait until the applause is finished and continue to sit down) so they are aware they are being watched. According to their dialogue, it seems to me they were once human, "Jane- were you blond?" but it does seem like they remember or who they were. They refer to each other by human names, but they seem confused or disturbed by their situation, "I wish they'd go away", probably referring to the unseen audience. The last episode offers a good climax but not a conclusion. Or is it? Are the rabbits unable to figure out a way out of their misery...or is this their reality as it always has been? Like the book I read, the children never did escape their house, but they did figure out they were not living a 'normal' life. Lynch has never been one to offer a comfortable conclusion to his work- so I would not be surprised if this is the end for his rabbits.
The single camera is fixed on a wide shot of a sparsely-furnished, eerily-lit apartment, a subdued den of deco and menace.  Yes, a glance confirms, Mr. Lynch is caretaker here.For five minutes, as Badalamenti's synths sigh over distant fog horns and muted thunder, we watch the rabbit people--actors in cheap rabbit suits worn under drab human clothing.  Their day is winding down.  They work at an ironing board, sit on the art deco sofa, rise, sit down again, exit, return, sing some verses about "dark, smiling teeth," and trade dark, smiling dialogue.  The rabbit people play to an unseen studio audience, which greets their entrances with on-cue applause and their oblique lines with canned laughter.  Minutes pass. . .  Then: a superimposed mouth begins a demonic incantation.  A huge match burns.  The camera blurs out of focus, and then--you'd better believe it!--refocuses.That's it.  The result is weird, beautiful, unnerving, and, frankly, never far from being boring.
Here, we get a David Lynch-ized sitcom set and our three characters, dressed in Rabbit suits. The "mystery" is knawing at these characters although what they say is often incomprehensable. On top of this, the piece is supported with a laugh track. I know what you're thinking. It's an absurdist film, right? No. I don't know how they did it with these elements that would seem laughable from afar, but you know what? You turn off the lights in your room and you watch all eight parts to this, and you'll have nightmares for a week. David Lynch can make anything terrifying. A complete surprise in mood. You won't forget it.
There's a technical term with which you must be familiar in order to begin to appreciate what David Lynch has created with this remarkable web series. That term is Diegesis which essentially means that the voices or sounds are in fact part of the world and moment which we are witnessing on screen. In the case of Rabbits it's a very intentionally open question as to just when and where and from whom is originating the spoken dialog, reinforced by the fact that we aren't able to see anyone's mouth. Perhaps the actors prerecorded their lines which are being played back as a soundtrack as they pantomime their roles? Or maybe the voices were overdubbed after the drama was videotaped? Do the words we are hearing even have anything at all to do with what we are watching? Are the words intentionally misleading so as to throw us off the trail of the real story? Is the dialog intentionally fractured & scrambled so as to disrupt any possible linear, literal comprehension? Was the dialog lifted from another source altogether?!More questions: Are the characters, in fact, aware of each other? Maybe they are figments of each other's imagination? Maybe they are reminiscing about their pasts, recalling individual episodes of personal experiences which hold meaning only to themselves? Do these characters live together, or maybe they each individually lived in the grim apartment consecutively? Is the male rabbit a visitor? Why does the unseen, possibly imaginary audience applaud excessively when he enters the room and stands oddly at the door, almost as though uncomfortable with the warm reception? Why does the mysterious audience laugh at seemingly random moments, which I at first believed occurred only in response to any mention of time or time related concepts, but this theory soon proved unsustainable? Are the rabbits related? Is one of the female rabbits the mother and the other the wife? And just who or what the hell is that bizarre mouth like orifice that occasionally appears and drones incomprehensibly while one rabbit conducts what might be a ceremonial ritual with flashlights? And what of the intermittently igniting match that burns into the upper right corner of the screen as though signaling a moment of particular import, and which sort of resembles those odd circular dots in older films that alerted the projectionist to an imminent reel change?Rabbits is anything but definite; it's so thoroughly, utterly indeterminate, uncommitted, tenebrous. Is it a simple Post Modern theatrical production being staged on successive nights - nine brief episodes totaling 50 minutes? Or is it a piece of Off Broadway Absurdist Theater intended as an homage to a time when commercial theater tolerated more daring, more experimental forms of drama? Is it an Off Off Broadway production still in rehearsals? Is it a security cam recording of a bit of extra curricular thespian activities? Or maybe it's even some bizarre theatrical cult that nightly conducts pagan rituals to appease the fickle and malevolent Drama Gods? Is it taking place in a theater, or on a Hollywood sound stage, or on the set of a show that David was perhaps hoping to convince some unusually brave or foolish TV executive to televise? Is it just a video record of shenanigans with some of Lynch's friends, made for their own amusement? Are they aware of what they are involved in? The possibilities are limitless as well as the questions, and that seems to be the point. Well, not the point, but the method; the method of Lynch's inspired, outrageous, ridiculous, sublime madness.What it seems to be is a purposely abstract, incoherent, ineffable expression of pure creativity. It defies all possible labels, genres and names, and seems to relish the precarious position it occupies in my baffled, bewildered, frantically deducing mind. It exudes such a sinister, almost macabre atmosphere, and yet it dares you to assume that there's anything suspicious occurring. Theater of the Absurd came into fashion in the late 50s, but the decor on stage is late 20s or early 30s Art Deco, so it may be that the furnishings have occupied this "room" for decades. Film Noir - Lynch's preferred form of cinematic expression - also came into fashion in the 50s, and the genre thrived in the same moody ominous atmosphere that this video piece exudes, thanks to Angelo Badalamenti's signature musical score which is particularly muted and subdued. The doleful, mournful wail of a distant train whistle is nearly comical and yet so poignantly evocative, as is the omnipresent gentle storm which drenches the proceedings in a corny, maudlin, overstated gloom. The stage set might bring to mind the bleak, stark TV set apartment that Jackie Gleason's Honeymooners occupied, which only adds yet another preposterously comical layer of meaning to the mix. And yet it all adds up to something indescribably eerie and treacherous.These furry, large eared characters might be indiscriminate, random creatures functioning as placeholders, as stand ins for real actors who may one day actually perform the piece. It seems to be suggesting that characters in drama are better seen as unreal, non human entities more appropriate and consistent with the artifice and unreality of the theatrical form. Lynch may be implying that a dramatic persona is best understood as a manifestation of a more fanciful non reality, a product of imagination & fantasy, and isn't that, after all, the essence of childhood play? But then why is it all so damn taunting and threatening?! The cumulative effect - as all the dark, dreary, heavy atmosphere might dictate - however, is not at all depressing. No, on the contrary, it's very compelling and disturbing and thrilling and wonderful. And that might be the most confounding part, just how profoundly pleasant an experience is David Lynch's Rabbits.
Lynch really elevated my opinion of him here. This is very, very well constructed. It is the highest art.That means that any "explanation" will be worthless. You can read some other material to discover something of what you will see.Its unsettling and strange, hypnotic and lyrical. That it is in several "episodes" is all a part of how certain familiar forms are subverted to give us something that has identity and also has a sort of meta-identity defined by deviance from the expected.My observation will be highly personal. I see this as a sort of "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern" but instead of referencing "Hamlet" engages "Alice in Wonderland." It fits, especially if you are inclined  as I am  to blow Alice into something as world-swallowing as Hamlet. Where Hamlet is all about what it means to sit in the world, Alice works at more refined level, being all about what it means to carry a name in the world.One is about being and the other about what we see and acknowledge about being. Its this second conceptual space that Lynch inhabits, always has. His "firewalking" TeeVee stuff bends notions of representation and discovery, the amusement being not in what we see, but in the difference between what we expect to see.Let's look at the entire vocabulary he has toyed with. First, he acknowledges the audience (laugh track), camera (static but in and out of focus), narrative (drawn more overtly by its fragmentation), framing (with very formal, abstract composition) and "acting," which here consists more of pauses and empty spaces than anything we normally associate with acting.And then there's the bending of the form. We have a demon that appears twice. Its noir drawn tightly, especially since there is a hint that the demon or his avatar as perhaps a "lost dog" is driving the entire situation. And then we have three "performances," one each by the three characters. These are accompanied by an ignited set, literally ignited. The performances, which each occupy an episode, are pretty transcendent in terms of what we would see in an ordinary drama. In such a case, each would "solo" in such a way that their soul was revealed. Its the challenge of the writer to weave this into events in such a way that we don't see the performer revealing his character overtly. This is different; all pretense is removed. The character enters and opens its heart with no narrative baggage. What the character tells us actually has more information about context than the surrounding context provides.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.
Everyone who has seen David Lynch's Inland Empire will be familiar with the rabbits of this short film (screened in some places broken down into episodes). Personally I struggled to work out if Inland Empire was brilliant or rubbish and ultimately I concluded that it was both but that it was worth seeing because of what an unnerving and unusual experience it was. The rabbit snippets are all part of it as they meant very little to be but yet managed to actually make me feel uncomfortable and uneasy while watching them. As a result I decided to check out the full Rabbits film.In an interviewer about Lynch's website project, someone did describe Rabbits as one for the hard-core Lynch fans and this description is bang on the money because it does deliver everything that he does well while also failing (or rather, not trying) to deliver in other, usual areas. Where the snippets hit home for me is in their sheer menacing stiffness. "Normal" things such as the apartment and the idea of a sitcom are all presented in a twisted and perverted way that Lynch viewers will be used to. Just like in Twin Peaks (where backwards characters talk in a red velvet room) the movement is strange, the lighting is eerie, the dialogue is confusing and the whole thing is delivered under a brooding score that suggests an impending destruction or evil.In this regard the film is quite brilliant and it is very disturbing to watch it in a dark room n a quiet night. But this is also the problem with the film because there is nothing more to it and ultimately the novelty value of it wears off long before the 45 minute mark. After a while I did want more but the film just continued to deliver what it had done at the very start. Die-hard fans of Lynch will love it and take pleasure in trying to pick the meaning out of it but for me it was more a matter of hanging on until the conclusion. It is a shame because in small sections Rabbits is really well done and fascinating. Lynch's creativity is powerful and works across the board  many have neglected to mention the physical actors in the film (not the famous voices) but their work is important, with a stillness and deliberate movements being key in the delivery.Overall then a very strong film for those that love Lynch's creepy work but it is hard to ignore the fact that the running time is too long to sustain the long pauses and very slow pace. As a result it never works as well as it does in its limited use within Inland Empire. Fans should still watch it for what it does well but for the majority of viewers the running time will be far too long and boredom may take away from the uneasy and creepy delivery.
This has got to be one of the most bizarre things that I have ever seen from Lynch. This was very creepy. There are moments when nothing happens, and then the rabbits start talking with one another, and it's utterly frightening. I can't believe Naomi Watts was in this. I thought that was pretty cool. The whole atmosphere, from the darkened room to the thunderstorm and train sound effects, adds up to an experience that you won't soon forget. It's fun trying to figure the mystery out. Part of that can be accomplished by putting together the puzzling dialogue in each episode. Hopefully, these shorts will be released on DVD soon. I also hope that "Lost Highway" and "Wild at Heart" also get their DVD releases soon.
Yes, everything is jumbled. It's all jumbled because that is how we experience life. It's how we, our minds, experience the sensations and stimuli that constitute thought and memory and perception. It's the phenomenon of awareness, how events effect our consciousness. It's how events are relived again and again in our minds. Our "Present" moment is constantly amused by, confused by, taunted by and terrorized by memories, impressions and feelings of past moments and events. Our "Present" moment is also assaulted, distorted, effected by future events or moments. How so? By thinking about things that have yet to happen, good or bad, we shape our present moment. The awareness of future moments and events brings pleasure, joy, anxiety, dread, terror into our present experience. Apparently it's mostly anxiety, dread and terror because that is how we are "wired" to react to the unknown. What's more unknown then the future? This is how we are experiencing the "Right Now". According to this experience – which is the "Real" way life enters and effects us – linear, chronological time is a poor, inefficient standard by which to relay or recreate that "Real" experience. You know how some movies reorder the sequence of events to make it fun, confusing, shocking to tell their story? That deeply felt "Aha!" moment when we finally get it, when it all sorts out in our minds. That experience is in fact what makes up "Reality", but occurring much, much more frequently. Occurring constantly, incessantly, eternally, like a never ending nuclear explosion in the mind. It's a terrifying, exhilarating jet stream of 'Aha!s" that constitute our experience of "Reality". You must respect the nature of the phenomenon of "awareness" if you are hoping to instill in your audience, not just information or a mood or a feeling, but a profound "Real" experience. Once you "tune in", then everything (suddenly?) falls in line and you find yourself. You find yourself not just "watching" and "considering" and "understanding" what's going on, but above all, experiencing it. It nearly feels as though it's your own original experience. Nearly.David's 'Rabbits" is a device to recreate his experience not just for our eyes, ears and hearts, but for our consciousness. At the moment we are "watching" his "Rabbits", we are also experiencing life in our nonlinear, personal way. Most people just aren't aware of it. The linear, sequential flat time of "traditional" movies actually is at odds with how our minds are processing "Real" life, but we have learned - been conditioned - to translate as best we can this unnaturally occurring movie information. As we have gotten accustomed to this convention of linear movie time, we have been adopting, and accepting, an inferior reality. A "Real" moment is "experienced", not just watched and heard. And a "movie" is only experienced as "Real" if our minds are processing it in the exact same manner it processes "Real" stimuli, which means not sequentially, but in an echoing, repetitive, staggered, disrupted, broken, vague order. David's "story" has therefore been translated so that it is similar, parallel, consistent with everything else that our mind is experiencing at the moment "Rabbits" is being "watched." You just have to understand the "language" that it's been translated into, which David gives some helpful directions to right at the very beginning and all through. It's by performing the slightly complex contortions of your awareness in order to experience his "story" that you are "opening" yourself up to fully receive, experience it. Once you make this necessary adjustment of your awareness you then "see" so much more clearly. It's one hell of an experience - the anxiety, dread, terror, horror, relief, joy, surprise, and desire are experienced much less out of confusion and much more so out of clarity. There's a "story" underneath, behind, around, within all this seemingly random oddness. That "story" is a very intense experience. And the experience is in the moment of accepting it.Sounds complicated but it's just like those 3d pictures that look like a flat repetitive pattern, but when you focus your eyes just right, you suddenly can "see" into it a very deep, dimensional object or scene that appears "real". You shift your focus just ever so slightly, and it's gone, flat and meaningless again. Same thing here, but the shift in focus is not with your optical vision, but with your awareness. The place or attitude or moment we must shift our awareness to is the key to unlocking the whole experience. And that's easy and tricky.It's an astounding process that David has employed. It's something he gleaned from his 32+ years of Transcendental Meditation. And all this just describes the process we must pass through to "get on" the right "eyes" in order to experience the "Real Story" that is "Rabbits". The "Real Story" is in the mind of the creator but it's equally in the mind of the viewer. True Theater of the Mind. It's like turbo-ultra-3D in the mind. And all done without drugs or a severe concussion.I came upon this awareness through his "Inland Empire" where "Rabbits" are so powerfully effective as an element of reverential doom(?). I transposed my experience with "IE" to find my "way" into Rabbits, which has a much less specific "story" compared to "IE." When you happen upon the "way" it all rushes up to greet you. You will know "Rabbits".
In a nameless city deluged by a continuous rain, three rabbits live with a fearful mystery.Starring Naomi Watts, Laura Elena Harring and Scott Coffey (though you wouldn't know - they all wear rabbits heads) this short series set in one room with an unmoving camera this Lynch series is possibly the weirdest thing he has ever done. With a screenplay given the Burroughs' cut-up treatment the answers come before questions or the answers come episodes after the original question and occasional episodes featuring singing cut-up monologues (one featuring Rebecca del Rio) this is obviously meant to baffle the viewer. Luckily, like all Lynch works, it doesn't matter whether you understand or not (I sure don't) you're moved by it anyway. It takes a few episodes to get into the swing of it (at which point you'll want to rewatch the first few) but by the end of it I was sure what I had just watched was absolute genius
Okay, I have been watching David Lynch's work since Twin Peaks. I have seen everything he has done from Eraserhead to Mulholland Dr. It's taken me 3 years to find a copy of RABBITS to watch and I must say... Lynch never ceases to confuse me.I understand why some people think Lynch is overly self-indulgent, but I don't think that is a reason to hate him and his work. Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. are two of the greatest film ever, but they are not for everybody.RABBITS is different than his films, and I am not going to act like I understand RABBITS or pretend that I found my own interpretation to the series. I don't know what I've just seen, I can't even tell you if it was self-indulgent crap or a work of genius, all I can say is if you like Lynch and want to see something different than anything you'll ever see anywhere else, than enjoy:)
This is one of the more bizarre films featuring humans in fluffy bunny suits.David Lynch juxtaposes Sartrean existentialism and American sitcom with an eerie, industrial-noir soundtrack to create a compelling, hellish universe like only he can.Also, this is maybe one of the greatest uses of bunnies in storytelling, since Lewis Carroll (with the exception of Hugh Hefner).With the recent influx of rabbit suits in other indie films, like Gummo and Donnie Darko, one can only expect this trend to grow and explode on the catwalks of Milan and Paris.
(I shouldn't say 'merely'. It makes it look like I'm downgrading this work, I'm not.)I think it's a mind boggling ride where traditional conventions of language, logic and storytelling are thrown out the window. If you want to understand this non-sequitur, surrealist style of writing please look up "Theatre of the Absurd". It'll explain this kind of work very nicely. Bravo to David Lynch for making a movie/play in this style!From Wikipedia(But please go elsewhere to get a deeper understanding): The Theatre of the Absurd (French: Théâtre de l'Absurde) is a designation for particular plays of absurdist fiction written by a number of primarily European playwrights in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work expressed the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.Traditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in The Theatre of the Absurd.[151] Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in Godot or The Bald Soprano. Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery....
I must start off by saying that only, and I repeat, only if you are a true lynch fan- you can appreciate this movie. Now, being the guy I am, I really tried to figure out what this is all about. But as it is with most lynch films, you can never really figure it all out. You can only enjoy what you are watching, and create theories of what you think is happening.Of course I'm wrong, and I think there is no right in this case. but when I started watching I noticed that some sentences that the rabbits are saying should be placed in order. When you watch it for the first time it may seem that they are just talking a load of nonsense, scary nonsense I must add, because what they are saying has a creepy feeling behind it.But I wrote the dialog of all 8 episodes down and however it leaves a lot still unexplained; it also made some sense to the story line.*SPOILER?* When placed in correct order, you have a dialog of the rabbits missing someone, and/or a dog. now, as they are rabbits and refer to each other as human beings, it would not be surprising if the dog was a human-alike creature too. now, something has happened to the dog, something bad. this, you can hear in the monologue, repeated but not exactly the same by all 3 rabbits. The fact that the man-rabbit goes outside and the mentioning of "it's probably the rain", I think, refers to them, waiting for the dog to come home. "He goes out at night, and comes home in the morning." *End Spoiler.*This spoiler is only a storyline on the surface. Of course this movie goes much deeper, but since thát is something we will never find out. (Lynch won't tell us either) It is up to yourself what you think is the message behind this movie. That is something you have to decide for yourself, and I would recommend you'll think about that before you read a so-called spoiler from someone that gives his theory. It can really influence your own thoughts and I think Lynch wants you to think for yourself, not many people do that nowadays. Anyways, for this is truly a dark, frightening, but very much weird experience, I would like to recommend it to all who like David lynch. especially if you can appreciate his short movies and eraserhead.It's a masterpiece that can inspire every film maker.
I have NEVER seen something so terrifying as this! It's three persons dressed up as rabbits on a fairly cheap set. That may sound ridiculous and it indeed is. Though what's going on here is insane! The reality as it appears in this film is dark as hell. "There is something wrong". David Lynch cuts through bone here! It's pure evil and fear that you will feel when you watch this! How this masterpiece of taste was put together? Hell I can't tell but here's my bet: "Take the thought of a weird dream, cut up some William Burroughs, add some Sonic Youth like charm, throw in 6.66 grams of Lydia Lunch, grab a sitcom and reduce it to its essence and blend the total while carefully adding some Fluxus performance. Cook it, bake it, whatever you like. Fruit some Dario Argento and finish it off by putting Michael Haneke's camera-guy on top". Have a great meal.
It's spooky, it's strange (hell it's even funny) and it's dangerously spellbinding!!! Rabbits is the mother and father of all nightmares. The acting, the movements, the lighting and the colors are all brilliant and some of the singing of Rebekah del Rio reminds you of Greek tragedy. I always say that there are no bad David Lynch films. There are just people who don't understand them. Once you take the trip down the abysmal world of the subconscious, you don't want to wake up. We all have fears and we all definitely have Rabbits in our heads. CAN'T WAIT for INLAND EMPIRE...
The rabbits are us in the way we live our entire lives separated from death only by our domestic routines of normalcy and our denial. Rabbits are bred for the slaughter; they live their entire lives in their little cage, surrounded by, and fed by, the very same people who will someday unthinkingly break their necks.They're traumatized by the collective memory of past relatives being snatched from their cages while the characters themselves were still too young to fully comprehend the severity and reality of what was happening. The horrors they witnessed so long ago are now just an underlying feeling that something is wrong. They, and we, live their entire lives among death, ignorantly and purposely oblivious of it, until the one day when they are able to ignore it no more, until the day it is their turn.That's what sense I made out of it anyway.
As far as I can see, it's that simple. 'Rabbits' is a sitcom. It's not a sitcom in the traditional sense, or any normal sense for that matter, but it's a sitcom from David Lynch's point of view.One recurring theme in all David Lynch movies is that he has a very uncompromising vision. Whatever he wants on the screen is what's ultimately on the screen, regardless of whether it's commercially viable or not.'Rabbits' is simply what David Lynch sees when he watches a sitcom. He sees animals placed in predetermined roles, forced to forgo any passion or meaning, instead focusing on hollow, meaningless lines of dialog, and cyclical patterns of behavior.Why does the laugh track play when nothing funny happens? Perhaps David Lynch is asking the same question. He watches a sitcom, and after a character says something that didn't seem funny at all, the audience erupts with laughter. The humor and situation are forced onto the characters and setting. It wasn't a joke because it was funny, it was a joke because the laugh track played.So what's the meaning? I don't think there is one, and that's the point. In order for there to be meaning, the rabbits would need to have some sort of freedom, or control over their situation, and they have none. They're in a situational comedy, and thus enslaved by their 'situation'.
This mini-series is the epitome of Lynch's dark and abstract side.  Like his other work that falls under this broad and vague category (Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, Eraserhead), Rabbits is easier felt than explained.  Having watched the entire series twice over the past weekend, I have started to form hypotheses on how this could be applied to our world... but there is no true explanation, nor does it warrant one.  The feeling you get by the end of the series is inexplicable and truly Lynchian.  The camera-work (on a DV) is beautiful and demonstrates Lynch's talents as a painter.  There is some really thought-provoking poetry involved, especially when each of the Rabbits gives a soliloquy.  And without spoiling anything, there are some truly frightening moments.  A must-see for Lynch fans and fanatics, and great reason to join davidlynch.com.  I can't wait for Axxon N!
I couldn't stop laughing and saying "What the eff". I found out later it was a horror movie.I highly recommend this if you're in an altered state. I actually have no idea what the movie was about. I need to watch it again. I'm not sure if you are purposely watching it that it will have the same effect, though.This was years ago. I just happened to run across it here on IMDb so I figured I would comment about what a trip it was.My wife also always tries to tell people about it but we never even knew what it was called until now.
"Rabbits" is a 43-minute short film from 2002, so this one has its 15th anniversary this year. The writer and director is the (in)famous David Lynch and the voices you hear in here are basically all people who worked with Lynch on "Mullholland Dr." and a couple other films too the most known being Oscar nominee Naomi Watts. Anyway, this short movie here is probably one of Lynch's more known short film works. Camera is static and we watch several rabbit characters from start to finish how they interact with each other. It is all very mysterious and offers lots of room for interpretation. There is not one definite explanation/elaboration that makes sense, but it is all about the subjective take on what you see and especially what you hear. Occasionally the action and dialogues are interrupted by laughter and other sounds from the audience making this one look a bit like a sitcom. But there is really nothing funny about it and if you take a look at IMDb you see that all genres are pretty much included here with the exception of comedy. So yeah as always with Lynch there is some mystery and darkness attached to the movie. Quality-wise it is nothing too memorable though and the statement I made in the title may very well apply. It was probably only clear to him, maybe to the cast too, what was going on exactly, but for audiences the film keeps losing itself in its dark atmosphere and mysterious plot on so so many occasions. Way too many for such a brief film. Watch something else instead.
This work must represent Lynch's musings on his craft. We see a sitcom. Actors are garbed as rabbits that are dressed as people. That is, they are not rabbits, "per se"; they are only (badly) dressed as pantomime bunnies within the sitcom, set obviously on a stage. Like Shakespeare's play within a play, we see a sitcom in a video (in a movie, inside Inland Empire). It is presented as an ironic "meta-tale". If we try to follow the sitcom we are misled. The laugh track isn't tracking identifiable punch lines. The dialog is out of order and seemingly not in sync with the present action. There is a narcotic dreaminess about watching the actors in the video playing characters in a sitcom. We lose context. What exactly are we witnessing? The meaning of the sitcom is not the meaning of the video, and therein lies the disturbing ambiguity of the unfolding story. The medium is not the message. Lynch knows his audience interprets him through the tropes of movie-making. He knows he must express his ideas within the boundaries of its form, subject to the expectations of his audience, who are likely to impose their own prejudices. The rabbits exist in a created exigency outside of real experience. They are motivated by their own ephemeral mythos, informed to action only for this short performance we are witnessing. The author feeds them soliloquy, to bridge the distance between himself and the audience, but with an absurd result. Will we ever know what they are thinking? No, because they are not thinking in reality, they are acting out roles in a disordered sitcom. This being said: The sitcom is about patricide. The mother waits for him, but Suzie and Jack have killed the father figure. It is an unspeakable crime that masks another. Dear dad may have had designs on young Suzie. Of course, it explains the dread and shame. I cannot prove it conclusively. On first viewing I was entirely riveted by it. On second viewing I was analyzing the heck out of it. On third viewing it struck me how absurd the whole thing was and I started to laugh at it. I began to think, this is what Beatrix Potters' recurring nightmare looks like.If you know who Luis Buñuel is, then you probably already own a bootleg copy of this video. If you can walk through a modern art exhibit without giggling then this movie is most likely for you. If Jackson Pollack reminds you of the oil stains on your driveway, then you probably want to steer clear.Lynch removes the burden of narrative from the story and fragments dialog out-of-sequence so you are free to get popcorn during any phase of the showing without fear of missing something.SPOILER ALERT!!: Nothing really happens. Well, a woman screams. And no, I have no idea what that means.
Back in high school, I knew a girl named Lydia who was so completely in love herself and her abilities as a poet, she claimed she could turn even the most mundane or even silly topics into works of art and depth.She was a loon.Watching this pile of crap made me think of her. It was as if Lynch woke up one day and said "Let's see if I can convince people to like absolute, nonsensical trash and believe there is depth where there is none! I'll take rabbits...no, people in rabbit costumes, yes! Throw in a little ambient ~nothing~ and see what happens. Oh and yes, a laugh track! It's brilliant!" Cue maniacal laughter.In any case, Lydia was a legend in her own mind. So is Lynch.
"Rabbits" is bizarre! In fact "Rabbits" is VERY bizarre! This short film from David Lynch is very weird in many aspects. From the peculiar rabbit suits to the absurd and weird laugh tracks everything is strange in this movie! It has always one scenario, a kind of stage scenario portraying a living room. The characters enter and they leave the scenario every time they do it we hear applauses from an unseen audience And many times, when the characters say something  that is NOT funny  we hear the laugh tracks, which are completely absurd, because they have no connection (at least a logical one...) to what have been said! The applauses and the laugh tracks give a nonsensical humor to the movie; but also a touch of oddness and irrationality The dialogs are also strange; they are disconnected, senseless and repetitive. In fact, the entire movie is repetitive, as an odd nightmare that doesn't end! I think that "rabbits" is an excellent short movie from Lynch, which explores one more time the boundaries of nonsense. It is mysterious, it is bizarre and it creates an odd ambiance, almost scary at parts (and here the soundtrack helps a lot, because it's really spooky) But I think it's a bit long! I know the movie is a compilation of 9 short episodes, which were a kind of a "series" made to the David Lynch's website. However, if you watch it just in one time, as I did, the all 50 minutes for once, it turns too long! I think it would work better if it was a short movie with about 20-25 minutes, because otherwise it turns overextended, repetitive and a bit boring. Maybe because it's always in the same scenario or maybe because it doesn't develops too much. I don't know, I just think it would be better if it only had 20/25 minutes. It would be enough to create the same impact and it wouldn't be boring. Probably there's a reason to that extension and to the repetitive scenes (I think it's very possible since it was something which came out from Lynch's mind), but even so it turns out a bit monotonous.Anyway, it's another mysterious, dark and weird "dream" from the master of surrealism!
As far as movies and films go there is entertainment and there is attempts at artistic, usually meaning the surreal and flamboyant, in which it seems Lynch likes to dabble. That isn't exactly the type of film I like to watch but I get into what I do see.Overall each uses a standard set of techniques and tones to set the viewer up emotionally and pull the average viewer through the story. That is what is so upsetting in 'Rabbits' and gives a very cool experience to anyone who enjoys "immersing" themselves in a movie but is not offended that in 'Rabbits' Lynch makes that near impossible. I admire that Lynch can cause as much tension, nervousness, and horror, by abusing conventional timing, mixing dialog order, and throwing off what the average film watcher has been conditioned to expect, than a baser film can do with buckets of gore and unrealistic violence. Some people may see things like the inappropriately timed laugh tracks as stupid, I believe it really depends on what your mind has been conditioned to expect. When I hear applause and laughter I expect comedy and action but instead Lynch delivers rain, grinding sounds, pockets of inactivity, which become evermore disturbing. My mind ran as I tried to order the slow coming dialog into ideas and arrange the story and the action on the same time-line. The constant camera angle becomes unsettling once you actually see a change, and nothing has made me jump as much as the second match, because I had become more scared of what I expected in a series where it was impossible to expect anything.My recommendation is to turn the lights down and watch the series all alone in your living room, whether you enjoy it or not, think its stupid or brilliant, a sitcom or horror, prepare yourself for a set of the hibi-jeebies that Freddie Krugger himself couldn't give you.
When I read the comments on the David Lynch works, it's always remarkable to see the division of people into two groups; one admiring the hint of deeper meaning in his works, and one disliking the lack of an obvious statement. I always start to think about the fact whether (David Lynch's) movies should carry out a more clear message... Fact of course is, that it is very interesting to see what people make of the movies. I think that the openness of Lynch's work allows everyone who watches it to think freely about the content. And that is what I think is a great thing about Lynch's work. This especially goes for Rabbits; the total lack of plot or explanation of the dialog made me wonder what it was actually about. I saw in the eerie house room a reflection of a domestic scene of some period of regression. There is shabby furniture, and a classical situation where the husband goes out from time to time (to work), the wife stays at home to iron clothes and what I assume is the kid is sitting on the couch reading. I got the feeling of a family situation that had experienced something horrific in the outside world, which is never shown. It came pretty close though when the door opened and a scream and flickering light suggested some bad events that happened on the outside, and were discussed through the weird dialog.All in all I very much like the way Lynch is making subtle suggestions and lets everybody free to wonder about the true meaning of his movies. Very inspiring.
Whenever I saw Mullholland Drive I enjoyed it because it was such an experience but yet had much for me to try and figure out  as hard as it was to do so. Funny then to watch Inland Empire and think that in the future, if it continues this way, that we will look back on Lynch's earlier films as his pre-weird period, which is strange when you watch Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet etc. However this is the place we now find ourselves with Inland Empire, a film that not only shuns narrative tradition but behaves as if such a thing has never existed. And to watch the film, well, you just need to accept this and deal with the fact that if you have even a slight grasp on the story then you should consider yourself lucky.If you can accept this then the film is flawed genius; however if you cannot accept this then the film is a shambles that will make you hate it almost as soon as you realise you will not be able to get to the bottom of it just by watching it tonight. The funny thing is that both camps are right in their comments on this film because it is at once brilliant and terrible  Jonathon Ross summed it up surprisingly well when he said it was a "work of genius  I think" because the impression left on me was just this.On one hand the film is almost impossible to follow and it is not just a glib remark to say that this does make Mullholland Drive feel like an episode of Eastenders in regards accessibility. The plot starts out as a mystery but pretty much disappears into a series of semi-connected fantasy (?) sequences where characters complete switch worlds and identities, terrifying characters loom large but yet are invisible to the viewer and a sitcom featuring rabbits is watched by a girl crying in her room. There is little here to help the viewer and there is simply no foundation for you to put one foot one and say "right, no matter what happens I know I am on firm ground here"; the film doesn't pull the rug from under the viewer  there is simply never a rug to begin with. To many viewers this will be the end of discussion but for my money I already suspected this would be the case and what I actually came for was the experience.In this area the film is both brilliant but yet flawed. It is brilliant because it literally does feel like you are falling through worlds of dreams. Lynch manages to shoot his scenes with the air of them being slightly (or totally) unreal. The effect is completely unnerving and an example of the power of cinema that he can move the viewer into such a place mentally that even a static shot of three people dressed as rabbits is quite terrifying. It is a skill he is famous for and he shows no sign of losing it. As an experience I found it engaging to a point and, unfortunately, that point was not 180 minutes. It is ironic to praise the film for its freewheeling experience but yet criticise it for being undisciplined but yet here we are because it does feel very much like a film where Lynch needed someone to say "look, you need to make it as tight as it is exhilarating".Nobody said this I think and as a result it outstays its welcome at times and the dips are just that much more pronounced. Fortunately it is not consistent but it does come and the conclusion of the film is worth staying for. Not narratively you understand (even though the threads do come together) but some terrifying scenes give way to closing credits of beautiful women dancing to Nina Simone's Sinnerman; does it make sense? Well no, but again it is all about the experience and in this regard it is fairly consistent. Another reason for seeing it is a performance from Laura Dern that only begs the question why she didn't manage to get an Oscar nomination. OK it was a tough year for actresses with Cruz, Mirren, Dench and Streep filling out the list but for my money Dern is as good if not better than all of them. Lynch plays out so much confusion and emotion in her face, with this making some scenes a story without a single word being said. Given how hard it is to understand what is happening in the script, it makes Dern's convincing performance all the more impressive. Below her nobody is as good but everyone does suit the material and Lynch's approach.Of course aside from Dern, the star is Lynch and his fans will come to this way the same Bruce Willis' fans come to a film because he is in it. His direction, editing and cinematography is masterful, which only really leaves his writing. Superficially he does fall down but yet he also produces a flow he understands as well as some brilliant specific moments  a line where a black homeless woman says "It's OK, you dying is all" is a wonderfully insightful remark that is all the more impacting for the throwaway delivery of it, a matter-of-fact summary of life on the streets in a tiny part of a bigger film.Overall then this is an impressive film that is as brilliantly bewildering as it is frustrating. Some will find meaning but the vast majority will be best served to treat it as an experience rather than a "film" as one would expect from any other director. Even on this basis it is not perfect and is easily too long to sustain but in this regard it is still worth seeing. Not sure if it is entirely enjoyable but for sure it is an experience I'm glad I had.
I saw this during a period of extreme emotional stress, probably the best possible mode. It was also surrounded by my listening to "Big Fish," Lynch's book, read by himself. The contrast is astonishing: Lynch's banal aphorisms in the book with rich, multilayered cinematic literacy in the film. Yet another lesson in relative articulation and the notion that an artist often is the worst authority on himself.Let's have no mistake: this film is important. I place it on my list as one of the two films of 2006 that you must see.There's a lot to say about this. I think I'll let others comment on Dern's attunements, and the general notion of the story having to do with guilt and sexual desire.I'll comment only on two aspects which struck me. The first was how Polish this movie is. Its Polish within the story of course: a good half of the action involves Poles. The plot device is a Polish curse that somehow bends time and causality. And there are some Polish locations as well.But the thing is shot using Kieslowski's mannerisms. Its a peculiar style that to my knowledge no one else has used. It focuses on two motions: that of the environment as space which governs and changes. And that of the characters in motion, but situated in the spaces. With Kieslowski, he literally splits these in the writer's mind by having his writing partner handle the noir bits, the controlling fate, and he handling the independently sprouting human seeds within. Lynch handles both sides by imposing schizophrenia.But its Polish in other ways too. The actor as Golem. The environment as interleaved worlds, each creating the others by being. Its a Kabbalistic concept. Both are characteristically Polish, usually associated with Polish Jews, but more deeply Polish. You can see how Lynch understands this because he quotes "The Saragossa Manuscript," a Polish film about interweaving of kabbalistic worlds and the causal confusion that it brings.The second thing is how he exploits this merger of folded narrative -- where actors write new worlds; layered emanations where worlds spawn others -- not parallel but linked in generative fate; geometric cosmology in which each act creates symmetries we encounter elsewhere.He does all this by elaborating on the symmetries of cause. Ordinarily something causes something else, never backwards. Here it IS backwards, forwards, sideways -- all the eight dimensions that an advanced student of the Maharishi knows... causal symmetries that have a geometry that doesn't quite merge with the geometry of causality. Oddly, the story does make sense if you simply relax the causality a bit -- its much more accessible than the "Twin Peaks" meander.I guess I should say that this is after the manner of the structure of "Finnegans Wake." Its not as elaborate of course. It didn't take 17 years and the deliberate intent of conflating all metaphors. But it is placed in a dream logic, a softening of the walls and hinges of what we make up as the logic of real life. Its Joycean through and through and not -- as some would say -- "surreal" as if anything not real is bent reality.I know of a few filmmakers who can work with these notions: Medem, Greenaway, Madden, Ruiz. This is the most delicate and focused I've seen in a long, long while. You really must spend time with it. You must.Here's a serious piece of advice though. See Lynch's "Rabbits" episodes first, separately, ideally a week or so ahead. Take them in as a standalone piece, a remarkable piece of film. Some of it is in this film, excerpted, extended, reshot and literally entered by all the Dern characters. But you'd be better having that anchor before starting this tempestvoyage.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.
I saw this movie this past Monday morning at the NYFF (New York Film Festival but I'm sure you probably knew that already) and I have to tell you, I'm at a loss at how to even begin writing this review. I gave it a little time to sink in and I'll just try my best to give you something.For one, as you probably already know, the movie is three hours long. It's one of those three hour movies where you really start to feel it about an hour and a half in. Now, I'm all for a movie of that length and sometimes even longer than that but really now, this movie should get cut down at least by a half hour. It's something that Lynch should consider but it doesn't sound like it's going to happen at the time of this writing. I don't mind watching a film where the director refuses to hold my hand and lets me work the details out for myself but watching this and trying to make any sense of it at all was like walking around in a dark forest with a blindfold on. After three hours of watching something like this, it does get tedious I'm sorry to say.I read a review somewhere describing the film as "impenetrable". I can't think of a better word to describe it myself. If you were to ask me what this movie was about, I really wouldn't be able to tell you. Now, that's to be expected from a Lynch movie usually but this movie is probably the most abstract thing he's done, Eraserhead notwithstanding. The movie seems to be more about the feeling itself you get from watching it, rather than having any kind of real story to speak of. This feels very experimental, especially considering the fact that it was shot on DV.I personally hope that Lynch doesn't give up on film completely because I think that while DV proved as an interesting choice in making this film, I think that very few people can give you beauty on film like Lynch does.The movie is loaded with those signature Lynch moments of menace that seem to treasure slowly approaching the corners of long hallways where something horrible may be waiting. Lots of tense, dark scenes with eerie music that suddenly becomes an assault on the senses. If you think of the diner scene near the beginning of Mulholland Drive, you'll know what I'm getting at. Now that I think about it, the film reminded me of Mulholland Drive in that it seemed to have it in for the falsity of Hollywood at times. I got that out of it, at least.The acting was superb. Laura Dern plays what feels like four or five different roles and her range is simply astounding. I've grown to appreciate Justin Theroux over the years and his character in this film is somewhat similar to the one he played in Mulholland, the cocky ladies man type but I really liked him in this. Also, this movie contains many of Lynch's old cast members and it was always fun to see who would pop out next.What I really liked about the film was the soundtrack. It's full of Angelo Badalamenti's dark work and there's a couple of great songs in there as well. I downloaded Beck's "Black Tambourine" after hearing it played in the film. I will definitely pick up the soundtrack for this one if it is ever released.There were surreal, beautiful moments that I should at least mention. There was a scene near the end involving a lighter that was really moving for some reason. There was also a kind of spiral, time warp, loop thing similar to when Bill Pullman answered himself on his house intercom (in Lost Highway). You'll see what I mean when you watch the film but it was definitely one of the better moments.I love David Lynch, I love just about everything he's done but in all honesty, this isn't a movie I'm necessarily dying to see again. I really want to tell you that I loved the film but I honestly can't. I do appreciate the effort. This is a film unlike anything I've ever seen before, that much can be said. It's just as weird as anything else he's done and if you're looking for a good dose of Lynchian madness, believe me when I say that you don't need to look any further. There are many of those strange moments where characters say strange things or act strange in general and wouldn't you know it, even a musical number or two sneaks its way in. I appreciate the man and I appreciate the fact that he makes daring, original work. But this was borderline frustration.I guess all I can say is that I liked a lot of it but at the same time, I really felt like I was wading through mental molasses trying to grasp what unfolded before me. There really is no sense in trying to make sense of this film but there's obviously some sort of story or message that Lynch is trying to get across that I couldn't get to and I think that's why I'm slightly put off. I didn't mind letting it engulf me in its strange universe but I think the length of it made it a little tough to appreciate fully.I didn't even mention the family of bunny rabbits. Or the random visits to Poland. Or the Locomotion dance number. Or the screwdrivers. But you can see all of that for yourself and make of it what you will.RATING: *** out of *****.PS I really tried to write an honest review of the film. I sincerely hope that at the very least, I was able to give you an idea of what to expect.
Nobody puts dreams -- or should I say, nightmares -- on screen better than David Lynch, and "Inland Empire" is perhaps the most nightmarish film of his I've seen yet.Laura Dern tears up the screen in a fierce performance as an actress who loses her identity during the making of a film and gets sucked into a vortex of terrifying imagery and labyrinthine parallels, otherwise known as Hollywood.We've been here with Lynch before, as recently as his last movie, "Mulholland Drive," which "Inland Empire" is a kissing cousin of. But this film, much more so than "Mulholland," defies categorization or interpretation. It's a movie that forces you to feel its themes rather than process them through any of the normal faculties we use to understand movies. But for all that, and even though it clocks in at three hours, it didn't feel indulgent to me, or pretentious, or like a random series of images that any old hack could throw up on the screen. Even on a first viewing (and I could use many more), I could see how tightly constructed the whole thing was, catch recurring ideas and motifs, recurring patterns, colors and textures. The film looks amazing; Lynch does wonders with digital film. I'm surprised myself that I didn't become frustrated with the movie, but it's so alive, and so purely cinematic, that I instead was completely engrossed by the pictures it had to show me.Though the movie belongs to Dern, a slew of recognizable actors appear in prominent roles or in cameos: Justin Theroux, Jeremy Irons, Diane Ladd, William H. Macy, Mary Steenburgen. Naomi Watts provides a voice.This is sensational stuff, extremely well done. A trip into the mind of David Lynch, even if you don't enjoy it, is one trip you will not soon forget.Grade: A
Inland Empire: it means Los Angeles, the place of Lynch's inspiration, but also the inward realm of the mind and of dreams, the surreal world of Lynch's imagination that uniquely inspires his visual poems. This new work, three hours long but unified by a savage and harrowing performance by Laura Dern channeling three or four or more overlapping personalities growing out of a lengthy free-standing monologue that was the film's starting point, is proof that the man isn't playing; hasn't lost his touch; still produces work unlike any other, work to be treasured.DL explores a universe reachable only by going past the rational mind. It is a realm where a character, in the present case particularly the characters played by Dern (the press cliché is 'career-defining performance'), turns into other characters and turns again. It's a realm where there's another world behind the sound stage and that other world is another life, another identity, another set of terrors. And we go there; we come back; and we go there again.After becoming the desperate monologist, Dern also became "Nikki," a movie star chosen with "Devon" (Justin Theroux) to star in a film, 'On High in Blue Tomorrows', directed by "Kingsley" (Jeremy Irons). And "Kingsley" works with "Freddie" (Harry Dean Stanton) a co-director who cadges money from stagehands and actors and apologizes saying, "I used to carry my own weight." On High in Blue Tomorrows turns out to be a remake of a doomed film, '4/7', never finished because both stars were murdered, and based on a Polish gypsy folktale. In the film Nikki, as "Sue," is cheating on her husband, and during the shoot Nikki's "real life"husband warns her not to do it for real. But of course she does: the film relationship parallels "real life," and the stars find they're confusing themselves with their film characters, just as it happens in Michele Piccioni's recent film, La vita che vorrei.That expletive-strewn 14-page ("single-spaced") ur-monologue that anchors the film was shot in the back of DL's house with a Sony PD-150 digital video camera he'd started to use in connection with his website, www.davidlynch.com, "a common midrange model" that sells now for $2,724. The monologue became the ground of being and the Sony became the simple visual tool that gave 'Inland Empire' its content and its visual style. Lynch has switched to DV for good, saying a sad farewell to the glorious beauties and cumbersome complexities of celluloid, and for this film embraced DV's limitations. He does not try to make it look like film. DL admits people say the quality is "not so good." "but it's a different quality. It reminds me," he says, "of early 35- millimeter film. You see different things. It talks to you differently" (NYTimes, Dennis Lim).This reversion, if you will, to a cruder visual medium (but one that's in many ways more fluid, both for the actors  who can work through without pauses  and the editor  who has handy software  and the crew  who can be fewer, and work lighter), has stirred up the director's creative juices, brought him back in a way to the raw energies and immediacy of Eraserhead. Thus it's a return to youthful beginnings and yet something completely new. It's burning the bridges and rediscovering roots at the same time., which basically is what any artist to stay alive needs to do.Dern anchors the film, but it has many elements that need anchoring. There is the disreputable husband of the disreputable monologist, who joins a Baltic circus.There's a woman played by Julia Ormond, who's first seen in a sleazy backyard with a screwdriver in her stomach, and later reappears as Billy's wife. And there's a Polish thread  which grew out of Baltic connections DL has forged and in the structure of ideas may trace back to the origins of the film of Devon and Sue (be the ur-'4/7'). There's a weeping Polish prostitute, watching a TV monitor on which appears a sitcom shot on a stage with people wearing rabbit heads; a laugh track creates a disquieting effect because the laughs come at "meaningless" points, giving the lines a sinister ring. Later the screen shows Sue. Slant magazine's Ed Gonzales smartly refers to the monitor as one of various "portals" through which characters merge into other worlds (go through the looking-glass; fall through rabbit-holes). Clearly it's all in the editing, and those who feel DL's creations are chaotic and portentously meaningless overlook his canny sense of structure.There's a group of pretty prostitutes in a motel room, who talk to Laura Dern's character and sing and dance, "Do the Locomotion," and then at the end lipsynch Nina Simone's "Sinner Man" behind the closing credits -- one of the great closing credits of recent decades, a rollicking, gorgeous episode, which cheers you up but still contains flashes (Laura's face) that haunt you with memories of the strangeness and terror that's passed.These are some of the interlocking boxes of 'Inland Empire'. DL mocks the idea of the "real" while using the concept to slide in between worlds.All this is gloriously cinematic.The film "technically" has no US distributor, though it has many European ones and the French Studio Canal signed on early at the stage when DL said he was using DV and didn't know what he was doing.The whole of 'Inland Empire' perhaps "resembles the cosmic free fall of the mind-warping final act in Mulholland Drive" (Lim), but on the other hand it has someone to "identify" with (if you can stand the ride) in Laura Dern, who dominates the film and threads it together. Her full-ranged performance is sure to gain much mention at year's end.After fifteen years of disappointment with and doubt about DL, it is possible to love his work again.
No seriously. WTF. Ignore my rating because a movie like this defies any kind of a linear rating scale. My real rating is: WTF stars. Everyone else can write their absurd words about the film but the only thing a normal honest person can say after watching this is... what the actual f**k did I just watch?Seriously, watch the film then come back to this review and tell me it isn't the most accurate summation of the film on here.Side note: Laura Dern seriously does give an incredible performance. No one quite captures the true essence of WTF like Laura. She really does elevate the film to higher levels of "WTF-ness" than it ever would achieve on it's own.For real though. What the actual f**k?
Much can be said about David Lynch but I think the mistake most people make is to think that he is trying to create a coherent and straight forward narrative structure. He is working on a subconscious level in his mind. The idea comes before the reason behind the idea. In many ways this is how art should be created because any other way will feel forced and pretentious.David Lynch is not just trying to f*k with you. Its not meaningless and its not pretentious. If you've ever seen his interviews he is one of the most humble and soft spoken directors I've ever seen. Justin Theroux did a Q & A after my screening of Inland Empire and he described working with lynch as light hearted and fun. The complete opposite of what its like to watch some of his films which are often dark, terrifying, and disturbing.Inland Empire is a sister film to Mulholland Dr. As my wife put it, "Watching Mulholland Dr. helped me to understand Inland Empire." They are two sides of the same coin. Lynch still seems to want to take a stab at the evils of Hollywood. His concern for the well being of actors is strong but this time instead of a new comer (Naomi Watts) he deals with one older actresses come back role and like Mulholland Dr. their are the evil producers behind the scenes and even the added possibility of a cursed set.I am a huge Lynch fan. I don't find his films hard to understand. I am not a very intellectual person but Lynch's themes are so simple. The visuals are to be enjoyed on their own terms especially when they seem not to fit with the rest of the film. A lot of lynch's trademarks return, the dual personalities, time folding in on itself, gratuitous nudity, and another tragic murder mystery.While this film does feel like a retread of Mulholland Dr. it also stands on its own especially since it contains a much more upbeat ending and perhaps four layers of storytelling,good luck figuring out which is which. He also continues to experiment with sound and even sings the vocals to a song in the film.I got exactly what I wanted from Inland Empire. The downside to this is that Lynch is sort of repeating himself and I hope that doesn't mean he's out of ideas or perhaps Mulholland Dr. did not yet exercise his disdain for the studio system. The film is part murder mystery and part lucid dream. It has dream logic and has a lot of fun with some of its bizarre dialog and incredible visuals. This film also has much in common with Eraserhead in that he's completely free to explore his ideas. No one is telling him to shorten the film, cut out scenes, or that it doesn't make sense. Its uncompromising and truly art without boundaries.My only other criticism is that the digital video is just ugly at times. When the shot is static the amount of detail in the picture can be incredible but when its hand held and moving around its grainy and looks pretty terrible. I miss the polished look of his older films but I guess that is going to be another thing that sets this movie apart from the others. I highly recommend this film to the Lynch enthusiast and to no one else. If you aren't in on the joke then I cannot imagine you leaving the theater happy after three hours of pure, free from concentrate, unpasteurized lynch. I went to see this with my wife and my best friend needless to say only I loved it. Take that as you will.4/5
Taking the murderous jealous husband theme of "Lost Highway" and melding it into the dreams of a tortured actress theme of "Mulholland Drive," David Lynch fluidly immerses his recurring dark fantasies into a story revolving around a Polish-Gypsy legend and a cursed movie production and delivers his most experimental film since "Eraserhead" with his epic three-hour "Inland Empire." The most experimental part of this is Lynch's use of a hand-held digital camera to shoot the entire film. While I personally prefer the deep texture of film over the superficial sharpness of digital, much of Lynch's trademarks translate surprisingly well to the new medium. Lynch's hyper manipulation of lighting, fading in and out of absolute darkness, super close-ups, transposing of images over one another, and making some scenes literally dissolve into the next frame, all come across sharp and artistically satisfying. There are points, however, where Lynch so repeatedly shows Laura Dern walking down dark hallways and dimly lit staircases into moody savagely lit rooms decked out with weird lamps that I half expect the director's next project to be a home decor line for the film-noir enthusiast.There will be those who wish to discuss the plot of "Inland Empire" and insist on figuring it all out. Upon first viewing, I decided to simply enjoy the ride. At three hours, there's lots of filler involving chatty and dancing prostitutes (who play the role of a post-modern Greek chorus and at one point do a rendition of "The Locomotion" that is both horrifying and hilarious), a sitcom staring talking rabbits, and some sort of complex story involving a Polish carnival, while inter-spliced into the madness is a wicked little psychological thriller about an actress who literally gets lost in her new role. The best morsels are the interwoven scenes of Laura Dern (beat-up, harrowing, and with a cool Southern drawl) waxing poetically in monologue fashion about her tragic love life to a man (presumably a therapist) and some beautifully shot scenes that take place on a dark snow-covered street in 19th century Poland that seem to have been exorcised from a completely different and dreadfully thrilling film. Lynch, however, gives many clues for those wanting to dissect the piece: 9:45, room number 47, a magic watch (similar to the ring from "Twin Peaks: FWWM "), the "LB" tattooed on Dern's hand, the letters "AXXONN" appearing repeatedly on walls and doorways, Grace Zabriskie's bizarre telling of an "old tale" when we first meet Laura Dern's character, and perhaps secrets hidden in the dialogue of the prostitutes, the rabbits, and Harry Dean Stanton. The film is so long, and so jumbled, however, that I think it's better to digest it as is, unlike "Mulholland Drive" which was exhilarating to examine "between the scenes."Lynch, forever in love with Hollywood as a city of dreams, is again master of the disembodied scene. Like Naomi Watt's mesmerizing audition scene in "Mulholland Drive" (which in no small non-ironic way launched Watt's career into the stratosphere) there's a killer line-reading about thirty minutes into the "Inland Empire" where you don't really care what Laura Dern is talking about or what film she is in, it's just you watching her playing an actress getting totally lost in her lines, and it's beautiful. Lynch's masterful juxtapositions of the profane with the profound, light with dark, beauty with pure terror, no matter what non-linear incomprehensible way they are presented, are true cinematic treats to experience for those willing to open their minds to the ocean of possibilities.
Lynch has very high artistic integrity. Lynch will never tell us what any of his films are about - if indeed he knows or would ever admit that a film might be about something in particular. There can be no evaluation of any specific interpretive approach. There must be such an approach, whether conscious or not. Lynch would likely disagree. He's right - and some of the disappointed reviews expressed here by his fans are nice examples of why this is so. I am sure he would also understand and agree with my rebuttal - "Who cares, it's fun" When fans either gush about the brilliance of a piece of work or resort to name-calling ("pretentious hipsters??"), the film is, like most works of art, not going to allow much of a middle-ground. A lot of smart and well-written reviews here on IMDb treat the technical aspects of the film. This review is not about HOW the film was done, but rather WHAT the film does. If you haven't seen the film, try this review on. If it doesn't fit, then I can't recommend seeing Inland Empire. If you do keep reading, get it into your head that there is no spoiler here, really. The interpretation offered below is not even an opinion -it is simply a facile, creative construct I use heuristically for talking about the film after my first viewing.If you have seen this film, you will probably view the interpretation below as too simplistic - that is, if you got it. That's fine. I do not care, but feel free to send me a note if you want to discuss it. Keep in mind - as I stated above - I am simply using this interpretation as a means for discussion. Don't take it too seriously, I really don't care to defend this. Laura Dern should win two academy awards for Inland Empire - for Best Actress as Nikki and for best supporting actress as Nikki's role of a lifetime - Susan. But she won't get nominated because this film will be systematically ignored by the mainstream. Why bring up acting talent so early in the review? Because this inherently non-linear film (though it is more linear and plot driven than Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway) offers one of many possible (possibly an infinite number of) linear interpretations - the film is/could be about acting and losing one's identity in a role. It could all be going on in Dern/Nikki/Susan's head as she comes to grips with what she is doing in the three levels of "reality" portrayed. If this particular interpretation were chosen, the free association between the roles played by the Polish actress/victim/perpetrator of the film "47" and that played by Dern's actress/victim/perpetrator in "Blue Skies" create a meta-text which, though unseen and unexplicated throughout the film, nevertheless identifies its subject as the disassociation and power of performance and creativity in the production of fiction/reality/drama. This interpretation is suggested by all of the many seemingly out of place and jarring details in the film - the usual red herrings Lynch throws at us to suggest that there may be some linear subtext in all of the sensual experience offered by his sumptuous, immersive films. scenes from the Polish film reenactment of the film by Susan - possibly in her dreams or fantasiesThe placement of the Polish actress into a couple seemingly disparate and unconnected roles (which, in fact make the creation of "Blue Skies" and the folklore surrounding its predecessor "47" unite at a different interpretative level) -The rabbit people performing within the television with an incoherent but suggestive script and an absurd laugh track and especially their audience (key to this interpretation because of its chronological placement in the narrative and the identity of the viewer). -Nikki's opening and closing scenes and Grace Zabriskie's foreshadow which identify closure for the meta-plot. The seemingly anachronistic white noise and record-cutting scenes and sound-cues, which occur at crucial transitions between the alternative realities inhabited by Nikki's disassociated personalities.If any of you find this interpretation compelling and would like to hear more about it, feel free to send a note. It is, in my opinion, just as worthless as any other interpretation of art - probably better left unexpressed and unexplained. But if having something linear to talk about helps you, you are welcome to further pursue it. Do not mistake this interpretation as an opinion. I have no opinion concerning the plot of this film. For my part, I completely understand the film through and/or without the interpretation above. Which pathway to the palace (is it Alan Smithee's House on the set?) I might chose, whether through the back alley or the front entrance to the studio (as the interpretation above offers) - I get it - just as I always "get" Lynch more than most directors. For fellow admirers of Lynch: IMO, This is a more coherent film than Eraserhead, a more upbeat and enjoyable film than Lost Highway, a less commercial film than Mulholland Drive (though it does bear some thematic resemblances largely because both films are overt self-referential interpretations of American media culture). You might talk about it for hours afterward, but this discussion will mostly only help you to know the people you attended it with better. Let it pour through your mind and soul. No profitable comparison to Lynch's more linear films can be made, although, on a second viewing of IE I may wish to spend some time thinking about the connection between the exploitation themes in Elephant Man and this film. Of course, the directing, camera work, and especially the sound design are flawless. Goes without saying.
Inland Empire is an interesting premise with an absolutely horrible execution. I've liked some of David Lynch's movies: Mulholland Drive was brilliant, Blue Velvet was good, Eraserhead was okay, and I've seen a couple of other of his movies that were not bad. I was eager to see Inland Empire but by the time I saw it I was disappointed and quite frankly bored to tears.As I interpreted the story (if one wants to call it a story) it was about an attempted remake of an unfinished Polish film which allegedly was cursed, and the new leading lady now gets to the point where she can't discern the difference between her life and what is being filmed for the movie and what happened in the unfinished Polish film- and we, the viewers, are not intended to know the difference either. But that interesting premise is watered down to nothing in its ungodly three hour running time, good acting notwithstanding. There are too many non sequiturs (the rabbits from an earlier project, the girls dancing while the Locomotion or what ever the hell it was was blasting, the seedy alleyway conversations behind the AXXON N door, the lengthy scenes of people brewing coffee, far too many close ups of ugly people whispering to each other, and on and on like that for three hours) to honestly say that there was any point to any of it. The camera work looked like something out of a direct to video horror movie filmed on a $100 digital camera, which doesn't help matters. Eraserhead looked good because of its low budget filming, it added to the atmosphere, not so in Inland Empire. Lynch overuses the quiet whisper immediately followed by screaming or loud musical score to the point of absurdity here. When that gimmick is used in every other scene, it loses its effectiveness, and merely becomes annoying. Almost all of the characters meander through bizarre living rooms, Hollywood sound stages and crumbling Polish factories, without anything to draw the viewer into what is taking place. Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' was brilliant: it had suspense and was intentionally funny, often times simultaneously (Winkie's anyone?) with great acting by all involved, and well photographed on the streets of Hollywood. Despite not making sense on first viewing, there is a somewhat discernible plot which only becomes apparent in time and after watching it repeatedly, and it also leaves many things to think about afterward, and makes the viewer want to go back and watch it again. Inland Empire had none of these. Mulholland Drive starts off almost making sense, but then two thirds of the way into it, Lynch pulled the rug out from under the audience's feet, to perfect effect. Inland Empire never gives anyone a chance to grasp at any thread of a plot, it never gives the viewer anything more than badly photographed images. No suspense, no humour, nothing. Initially, I didn't understand Mulholland Drive but it stuck in my mind and I wanted to go back and watch it again to figure it out. I don't understand Inland Empire and don't want to understand it either. I don't have too much of a life, but still, I can't talk myself into sitting through this three hours of digital vomit again, just to try and figure out *if* there is anything to it. I feel like I should take another shower after having watched Inland Empire, and then watch Mulholland Drive again. * out of ****
David Lynch, the visionary director who created unforgettable films revealing darker realms of life such as "Elephant Man" and "Blue Velvet" and who brought to mainstream TV a deeper aesthetic and consciousness with the "Twin Peaks" series, unfortunately went overboard with "Inland Empire" writing and directing the worst film of his career."Inland Empire" is arguably Lynch's most ambitious effort: a meandering three-hour dive into a nightmarish dream world where all his previous themes and obsessions convey. There are enslaved women (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks), women in trouble (Mulholland Drive), supernatural entities in other realms (Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive), dissociative fugues and alternative realities (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive). As expected of a Lynch movie, the cast is top notch starting with Laura Dern and it even includes Jeremy Irons as a movie director. But the direction and the script fail to give us something of depth or a remotely compelling, entertaining story, therefore this Lynchean nightmare becomes endless, pointless, and ultimately boring. Each shot of dreary,dilapidated Polish buildings or empty and dark Hollywood sets become endless. Every time the character are hurting or menacing, the camera does a close-up distorting their faces or they behave histrionically as in the worst of the Mexican telenovelas. This is simply poor direction. These close-ups and long shots, among other cinematic pyrotechnics, are Lynch's filler to disguise the emptiness of "Inland Empire," Although both films are similar in plot and style, "Inland Empire" suffers compared to "Mulholland Drive." Lynch deserved the Oscar for that brilliant film which is memorable for its character development along a dark psychic ride, elements that are missing in "Inland Empire" replaced by a cheap thrills posing for art and profundity.The plot is vintage Lynch, but it is the most convoluted, longest, and silliest of them all. Lost Girl, an enslaved woman in Polish hotel/purgatory watches shows on a psychic TV: a sitcom with supernatural rabbit people, scenes from a Polish film that never got finished because the leading actors were murdered, and the life of an American actress who starts in the remake of the Polish film. Nikki (Laura Dern), the actress, begins an affair with her leading man and freaks out entering an alternative reality becoming Sue, the white trash character she is playing in the movie. Sue is having an extramarital affair with Billy, a rich man, and lives with Smithy in the house of the movie set. Sue is psychically connected to enslaved prostitutes who teletransport themselves from the snowy streets of Poland in the 1940s to present day Hollywood Boulevard. The prostitutes talk about men, love, and T&A and suddenly burst into dance for no reason - they do a killer number with "The Loco-Motion" which is unfortunately too short. Sue's husband, Smithy, who is Polish, leaves for Poland to work with a circus. Sue goes to see Billy and Billy's wife beats her. Sue becomes a whore working Hollywood Boulevard with the dance-loving, space/time-jumping whores. The Phantom, an evil supernatural man who has Lost Girl enslaved in purgatory, kills an early incarnation of Smithy who was Lost Girl's lover. The Phantom hypnotizes Billy's wife who is the reincarnation of a Polish woman who was stabbed to death with a screwdriver by the original actress in the Polish movie. The rabbit people are also wise, older Polish men and have a séance with Lost Girl and they bring Smithy to talk to Lost Girl. The old men give a gun to Smithy to kill the Phantom. Sue gets stabbed with a screwdriver on Hollywood Blvd. by Billy's wife and dies. That is the end of the movie and it is a wrap. Nikki is congratulated by the director but she ignores everybody and walks away from the movie set remaining as Sue. She goes to the house where she finds the gun Smithy was given by the old men. She goes through some dark corridors and finds herself in the Polish hotel/purgatory where the Phantom is and as she shoots him his face becomes Sue's own distorted face. The Phantom dies and all the women are free and Lost Girl reunites with Smithy and her son. Then Nikki is back in her home and all the women have a big a party and some women shake their booties to a Nina Simone song. They are in a kind of good place, not purgatory. It is not clear whether Nikki/Sue was an invention of Lost Girl who had been the real murderer and was in purgatory or whatever; in the final analysis, it does not matter because the movie is empty and lacks any redemptive qualities.It is hard to understand why some of the critics and audience fail to realize that this is a very bad film, poorly written and badly directed. Lynch is a true artist and has done some remarkable films for which he should be praised, alas, "Inland Empire" is a disjointed, tedious, nonsense mess filled with pretentiousness. If you want to waste three hours of your life with a superficial mind-tease filled with pseudo transpersonal psychology and collective unconscious references, see it at your own risk.
Inland Empire is the Man with a Movie Camera of the 21st Century. It is the most experimental, surreal, and technically brilliant film I may have ever seen. Lynch proves that all he needs is a simple DV camera to show the world the entire range of human emotions and the human experience from the happiest to the darkest moments we must go through to achieve salvation and cleansing of the soul. This film is not so much about a particular story or narrative as it is about analyzing, exploring, and creating a visual palette for ideas about traveling to and from the past, present, and future as it relates to our constant journey back and forth into our own psyches and our collective unconscious. Each of Lynch's films explores the mind in terms of Jungian philosophy, focusing particularly on The Shadow; however, Inland Empire goes further in this direction than any film previous to it. If Mulholland Drive was 25% a dark and surreal suspense thriller ghost story and journey into the nether regions of the mind and 75% classical, yet not necessarily structural or connected narrative, Inland Empire is 10% straight narrative and 90% raw psychological horror ghost story.The journey is long and hard but at the end you will be rewarded with the kind of peace and serenity that can only come from a meditation this long, deep, and powerful. I was filled with only inner bliss as I left the theatre and slept like a baby, completely at peace. This is David Lynch's most powerful film and speaks volumes on the many unexplored topics of how this medium can communicate, terrify, and heal in ways we have not yet even begun to understand.
Shot, in its entirety, with a simple digital video camera, Lynch's 'Inland Empire' isn't different from his other films but it is completely something else. The hand-held DV cinematography gives it a less polished look but works in favour of the film giving it a raw, voyeuristic and gritty feel. The shots are brilliantly clumsy with effective close-ups and long shots. The camera beautifully captures that element of fear, chaos, somberness, isolation and hate. The lighting also works excellently, as it does in almost all Lynch films and 'Inland Empire' too is very colourful like 'Mulholland Drive' and 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' but notice the different use in all three films. The soundtrack is mesmerizing and, at times, haunting.This may not come as a surprise but one should not expect a linear story from 'Inland Empire' (but that's not to say that there isn't a story). It's pretty much like being stuck in a manipulated time capsule until one is finally released after having 'completed the task'. In spite of the almost 3 hour length, one does not notice the spilling time as 'Inland Empire' jumps from moment to moment and back with no concern for time. The audience, like the characters in the film, also experience deja-vus, losing or rather questioning the sense of time and reality. There's also the Lynch humour to provide some laughter (at times the audience would be laughing at themselves).'Inland Empire' is about Nikki/Sue's journey. Lynch bravely paints the picture of his protagonist with passion, sensitivity and delicacy. Centred around Laura Dern's character(s), we pretty much go through what she experiences which is a real mind f***. After a long time, we get to see Laura Dern in a role of substance. In terms of performances, 'Inland Empire' is a one-woman show that belongs to Ms. Dern. The actress is phenomenal and it's a real shame that one of the finest performances in recent cinema has gone ignored. She displays a range of nuances as we get to see her with shades of Betty Elms, Diane Selwyn, Rita (from 'Mulholland Drive') and Laura Palmer (from 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me')and more. The rest of the cast that includes a charming Justin Theroux, a barely recognizable Julia Ormond, a scary Grace Zabriskie, a 'humble' Harry Dean Stanton and an ambitious Jeremy Irons are all impressive too.To say it in a few words, 'Inland Empire' as an experience and an experience can be best understood when a person goes through it rather than read about it. Therefore I'd suggest that one just go and watch it, rather than read about it. I must also add that this is a film that will not appeal to everyone, especially those who do not particularly like this kind of film (duh). It is one film that requires (and deserves) repetitive viewing because the more one watches, the more discoveries to be made. Another terrific achievement of Mr. Lynch!
I just saw this film at the New York Film Festival followed by a Q & A session with David Lynch, Laura Dern, and Justin Theroux. I will try my best to recount my thoughts while they are fresh, and incorporate what the film maker and actors had to say. "I can't tell if it's yesterday or tomorrow and it's a real mind f---" This single quote from Laura Dern sums the movie up fairly well. It is also one of the self- referential moments of the film that explores the audiences very thoughts while providing some comic relief. Lynch's new film, INLAND EMPIRE, is similar to his other work, but unlike anything he's ever done, or I've ever seen before. As one reviewer aptly put it, it is a double reference to Hollywood and the inner workings of the human brain. Before I discuss the substance of the film I will briefly review the technical aspects. First of all, the movie is not unwatchable (because of clarity purposes) as some critics had said, although I did see it at the Lincoln Center which has a beautiful theater and top quality facilities. The digital camera works well for this film. It lose some of the cinematic flourish of film, but also brings a more realistic, gritty feel to it that is appropriate for the theme. The lighting and production were top quality as usual for a Lynch film and the score sets every scene brilliantly. Often times we can't tell if the sound is diegetic or non-diegetic, but it makes no difference. Lynch said that he used the digital camera to give him freedom. You can see much more movement in this film than his others, giving an almost voyeuristic feel. He also uses many close shots, and as always, obscure framing allowing ambiguity and confusion. Lynch really explores the freedom of movement and editing that is available with digital, and you can feel his energy and zest in the new medium. The moments of suspense and terror are so well done - there are several scenes that will literally make you jump - that I found a Hitcockian brilliance of using subtlety, indirectness, and sound to convey emotion rather than expensive special effects. Of course, there are other scenes that would qualify as downright freaky.The movie is completely carried by Laura Dern, and not because she is in 90-95% of the scenes. Her character(s) morph and change so often in identity and time that it is hard to believe it is her in every role. Her range and ability to work consistently over so many years and under the conditions of this film is mind blowing. It is one of the finest performances I've seen by an actress or actor. The film itself is hard to summarize. Most of you know the basic plot, but this really means nothing about the film. It has no type of linear story line and the converging and diverging plot lines are connected by only the most simple threads, time, location, memory ("Do I look familiar? Have you seen me before?") identity, and people who are good with animals. It would be a disservice to this film to try to find meaning or symbolism as I see some people already are. It is not a mystery to be solved, as Mulholland Dr. was (though that film never will be solved either). It is a movie that plays off of ideas, color, mood, it presents intangible emotions that we feel and internalize rather than think about and solve. Film doesn't need a solution to make sense, but it is typical for us to want solve things, to have closure. This film is better if you just let it wash over you and surrender the urge to find meaning.The three hour running time makes no difference because the movie moves in and out of itself with no regard for time. Using so many scenes allows time to effect the viewer much as the characters themselves. As the characters question time and reality, the audience does too. As the scenes slowly build up, giving us reference, we start to wonder where we saw that character, who said that line before, what location fits into what part of the sequence and how, leading up to the Laura Dern quote I used before. It doesn't ask us to think, but to feel, and it does this better than any film I've seen. It plays on our emotions with intense sound and cinematography, grasping fragments from dreams, sliding in and out of reality, exploring nightmares, and asking us what time and reality really are. The film is also very self-conscious as I said before, and also makes many subtle (and not so) pokes at the audience. It also has some truly surreal moments of Lynch humor. Explaining all this doesn't really matter because you will have to see it and take your own idea from it. I would recommend that you see it in a theater though, as it could never have the same impact anywhere else. I was skeptical going into this movie after what I had read, thinking Lynch had gone off the deep end. However, I realized nothing you read about it will make a difference once you see it, and that Lynch is in better form than ever. Ebert said that Mulholland Dr. was the one experiment where Lynch didn't break the test-tube. With INLAND EMPIRE he throws the lab equipment out the window. His freedom in making this movie, both with medium and artistic control, is unparalleled in anything he's done. He finally made a movie for himself and his vision, without any kind of apology or pretense.
Alternately brilliant and massively self-indulgent, (three hours? now really, David!). A reasonably straight-forward narrative, (a movie is haunted by the 'ghosts' of a former production of the same tale), is turned inside out, upside down and completely spatially altered by Lynch's unfettered and, you may say, unique imagination.Watching this film is like being allowed access to a very talented and very disturbed artist's psycho-babble. Or maybe it's just a very egotistically talented artist's gigantic joke, (who or what are the giant rabbits?). Whatever, it is still hypnotically watchable which says a lot for Lynch. I can't imagine any other director making this movie, (or any movie like it, not that there might be), and keeping you interested or making you care about the outcome or the fate of the characters, or rather the fate of one character, the actress playing the leading role in the film within the film and whose dream/nightmare most of the film seems to be.For this we have to thank, not only Lynch, but the extraordinary Laura Dern who gives a tour-de-force performance. She's all over the shop but then I suppose that is what acting is all about. Above all, she convinces you that this is serious stuff or at least that she is taking it seriously even if no-one else is. Shot on digital video it is also as much 'about' the process of creating, as opposed to 'making', a film as it is 'about' anything else and in the performances Lynch extracts from his cast, (and not just Dern), you could argue that it is also about the process of acting.It is also far from being a great film, (though it has at least one great sustained sequence - you figure), and at times it resembles nothing more than the out-takes from "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Drive" though it lacks the cohesion of those films, (it's the most off-the-wall of any of Lynch's works and that includes "Eraserhead), and yet it is still extraordinary, unmistakeably the work of a unique and visionary artist and no-one, only Lynch, could have made it.
For those who felt Lynch's last film, Mulholland Dr., was too easy, I present to you Inland Empire. The director takes the whole dream (or nightmare) narrative a step further and makes the narrative even more fragmented and impossible to follow. There might not really be much of a narrative at all. The recognizable plot begins with Laura Dern as an aging actress, having spent a while as a housewife, trying to re-enter the movie industry. She wins a role and, during filming, she starts to fall for her co-lead (Justin Theroux). Which is strange, given that the film is about a straying housewife. Soon, real life and screen life become completely blurred, until the actress only exists in her fictional life. Maybe. God knows at this point. The film becomes completely incomprehensible by any conventional standards. Which doesn't in any way mean that it's worthless. Like all Lynch films, Inland Empire is deeply hypnotic, often haunting and occasionally downright scary. I wish there were a little more sense to it so I could connect a bit more. And the fact that the film runs for nearly three hours; it's easy to get restless. I think a good number of people are going to find this to be Lynch's folly. It is disappointing, especially as we've waited five years since Mulholland Dr., probably his best film, but there are a few of Lynch's movies that I like less than this.
The bulk of that line refers to a quote from the film Inland Empire- spoken in a cameo by William H. Macy as a TV show announcer- and one might be tempted to use that as the template to try and 'figure out' what happens through the course of the film's three hours. It is indeed, especially on a second viewing, the most intriguing and useful theme for what goes on with the character of Nikki (or Sue, depending on the scene or mood of the moment), as she goes through what can be described as, well, indescribable. But the line is helpful to look at what director David Lynch is most after and interested by with the film- dream logic. More over, the dream logic of life, and how it relates to the cinema, and to perceptions, and to, as the tag-line suggests, "a woman in trouble." But all of this still can't really help me, even on a second viewing, give at all an idea of what to expect with Inland Empire. It's a dense, ambitious, graceful, crude, ambiguous, and flawed work of the highest order of abstractions put together into one big Lynchian package. And don't forget the rabbits with that.The first time I saw the film, I was more swept up into the emotional mix & match that Lynch threw up on the screen, and by the immensity of how beautiful he was able to put everything together through his DV camera (like with Eraserhead, he plays with a form that is difficult in some ways, but inviting and exciting in others). The second time, I thought that it could be another excursion as Mulholland Drive was, where I could focus more on piecing whatever the hell kind of puzzle Lynch put up for the audience to possibly figure out. About half an hour into the film, however, I realized it was an act of futility to 'figure it out', at least in any conventional sense. But this is not necessarily a bad thing, even if it leaves the audience sharply divided as to take it: the greatest mind-bender of the new millennium, or the pretentious ramblings of a director un-hinged? I maybe went more with the former, even as I could understand the latter; it allows so much thought to come out of what happens in terms of characters' behaviors, of themes that emerge, and what might *seem* to come together when it really doesn't. What it lacks in narrative flow it makes up for with an originality in delving into personality, and what personality even means.At first it might seem as if there's a simple story here- Laura Dern as Nikki gets the part she's been waiting for, in a film by the great director Kingsley (Jeremy Irons), and with a fine co-star (Justin Theroux, even better here than in Mulholland). The actors find out though in a moment of confession from Kingsley that the project they're about to work on is technically a remake of an unfinished film where on the project the two main stars were killed, as there was a kind of 'curse' on the project called "47". It isn't long after this that Inland Empire gets even weirder than before, but by weird will be totally subjective to the viewer (and may depend as well on how much you're familiar with Lynch's world- or thought you knew what it could hold). Lynch then submerges Dern's character(s) into a landscape of suffering and bewilderment, where sub-plots possibly emerge involving a Polish circus, a murder via screwdriver, a "sitcom" TV show involving rabbits on a couch, and Nikki/Sue caught up in the maelstrom of an abusive downfall.A lot of this madness that comes through in Lynch's style, which is as audacious and remarkable and totally mesmerizing as it is going almost over the edge with its delirious need to push the dream logic and surrealism to its limits, could not be completely of worth without Laura Dern, who in particular is almost on equal footing of Lynch with heart and soul poured in. As required for looking at what it means to be an actress, or what it means to be a person, or to have a reality shattered by various un-realities, Dern is always perfect in relaying her emotions, however intense or drained or shocked or horrified they may be (or, sometimes too, of just listening to someone, like in that wonderfully batty scene shared with Grace Zabriskie as a 'neighbor'). It's probably the pinnacle of her career thus far, with everything she's ever either hinted at or shown as an actress up till now thrown up on the screen to match up with the wild demands of Lynch's own mind-set. It won't win an Oscar for her, but she should at least get a nomination, if it even means anything at this point. In a sense, this IS what acting is all about, at least for the sake of what Nikki has to do to play Sue, and vice versa, if that make sense.So on a second viewing did I understand Inland Empire any better than the first time? Probably not by much, and I actually still felt the flaws that pecked away the first time, namely that it does go too long, becoming sluggish towards the end (albeit with an astounding end credits sequence), and every so often a moment or scene felt too over the top. Yet overall, this is a film filled with so many ideas, so many visions, and so much to cast into one's mind about the nature of reality, of what it means to see an un-reality (either through the media, or through a form, or just in front of one's eyes like Dern with the "hot" girls who dance to the 'Locomotion'), and how things are never, ever as they seem. Just like Hollywood, one might say.
{i checked the 'Contains spoiler' box with ironic intent: this movie has no plot to 'spoil'.} 'show business' is only an oxymoron to those who don't understand that unless there's a dialectic between what the audience wants (escapism without real consequences) and what the artist wants to convey (that he/she has a unique vision that must be taken seriously), what you wind up with is meaningless navel-gazing.if there's too much control by "the suits", you wind up with "Home Alone XX". with just the right balance between suits and a visionary artist, you may get masterpieces such as "Blue Velvet", "Lost Highway", and "Mulholland Drive". however, once the lunatics are in charge of the asylum, all too often the result is an incoherent mess like "Inland Empire." Woody Allen has made a career of dramatizing insights derived from Freud. analogously, the tapestry that connects Lynch's work is the mad interplay among the Jungian themes of Shadow, Self, Anima, and Animus -- but, however much (or little) dreams may illuminate our waking reality, dreams that have no referents besides other dreams, if that, merely obscure rather than illuminate.after a beginning that suggests we may be in for another fascinating closeup of the Munch-like horrors lying just beneath the surface of the Norman Rockwell reality we still cling to when our guard is down in a movie house, all too soon we find ourselves sitting through 3 hours of boring non-sequitors.the scary scenes don't scare, the sexy scenes don't arouse. because one of the most fundamental drives of the human psyche is to find meaning (something that artists of the absurdist school might pause to ponder), the viewer's attention winds up being riveted on Lynchian tics like light bulbs and overapmplified sounds of the background noise on a long distance phone call (or is it the sound of bathroom plumbing? -- who knows or cares?). the unintended result is that it feels like a parody of Lynch done by Mad TV. (it's too loud, too lacking in any subtlety, and just plain too ugly for SNL).one of the less commented upon features found in all of Lynch's films from "Blue Velvet" on is that they are visually gorgeous. "Inland Empire" looks like a video-to-film transfer shot on a cheap camcorder. (indeed, from what i've read, it WAS shot on a cheap camcorder.) it's sad, and disappointing, to see a great artist lose his way. Let's hope Lynch is back to his otherwise superb form in his next film.
I saw INLAND EMPIRE at the Venice Film Festival world premiere last month. I want to keep this review short due to the fact that writing in great detail about this film is useless. INLAND EMPIRE is an experience. An experience not to be written about but to be FELT. It is David Lynch's definitive work. It's everything he has ever wanted to put into a film and it's completely free from anyone else's taming influence. The film is suffocating, dark and endless yet paradoxically contains some of the director's funniest and lightest scenes. I was frightened, uneasy, overwhelmed and moved. My emotions were thrown into disarray several times during which I lost all sense of appropriate reaction. Do not expect the mystery of this film to be solved, but expect it to be finished. Do not expect your head to understand the resolution but expect that your heart and intuition will.If you cannot decide whether to see this film or not, I implore you to get up and go. Whether or not you enjoy it, you will never see a film like this again. I also implore you to see it IN THE CINEMA. Do not wait to see it on DVD because the experience won't be half as extraordinary.
I just saw the NY premier of Inland Empire, and it was so refreshing to once again be transported in a way only David Lynch can transport somebody. Inland Empire is Lynch at his best - funny, thoughtful, eerie, beautiful, dark, deeply disturbing, and terrifying in a way that few horror films have ever affected me. The film is a slow burn, taking its time (about 3 hours), leaping through realities and bizarre encounters, continually keeping the audience asking themselves what reality they are experiencing, and what that reality means.Laura Dern gives an outstanding performance as the tagline's "girl in trouble." She goes to places I don't ever remember seeing her go, from the naive to the terrifying, truly exposed. I've heard Lynch is campaigning for an Oscar nod for Ms. Dern, so maybe this is the one. She really blew me away.This film - like all of Lynch's endeavors - is certainly not for everyone. It's vague, bizarre, jumps all over the place, and at times is deeply frightening (one of the few films in a long time to actually give me nightmares), but in my opinion it's also truly beautiful, almost serene. If you like a linear, clear-cut story, then don't see this film. If you appreciate non-linear, surreal drama/horror, however, then by all means go see it. Lynch is independently producing this, so I know he's banking on a lot of word of mouth for Inland Empire to be successful. Help him out. It's a fantastic film.
It wasn't my idea to watch INLAND EMPIRE . I kind of got talked into by some very nice people who I respect very much . I respect them so much I will not embarrass them by giving out their names but they know who they are and they're going to the cinema to see Nuri Bilge Ceylan's IKHIMLER next week and because of their taste in film I think I'll stay at home because in my humble opinion INLAND EMPIRE is one of the worst pieces of dung ever committed to celluloid I'm not a great Lynch fan but I did enjoy THE ELEPHANT MAN and WILD AT HEART had its moments as did ERASERHEAD despite - or because of - its bizarre atmosphere . If you liked these movies you will hate INLAND EMPIRE . If you disliked these movies you will absolutely despise INLAND EMPIRE . If you loved these movies you will possibly only merely dislike INLAND EMPIRE !!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!! The problem with the movie is that it feels like it's being made up as it goes along . That's because the movie is being made up as it goes along ! We start off with a man and woman their faces obscured speaking a Slavonic language about to have sex . We then cut to a situation comedy starring what can only be described as " Rabbit people " which is being watched by a weeping woman . The story then cuts to movie star Nikki Grace being cast in a film that was previously abandoned during the production stage because the male and female lead were murdered " Hey Theo I think I know where this might be heading . Nikki finds herself caught up in a dangerous situation ala classic Hitchcock " Yeah well that's where I thought it was heading but then .... well I don't know what happened because everything started going haywire . Nikki finds herself caught up in a kind of metaphysical universe with another visit to the rabbit people I thought I'd missed something so popped out of the cinema for a cigarette just to see if my confusion was caused by a lack of nicotine . I returned and instantly thought I'd walked into the wrong screening because the story now involved whores dancing around to a pumping soundtrack of Little Eva . More cuts to Nikki in a metaphysical universe , more cuts to the rabbit people sit-com . After two hours of this esoteric crap I decided that I'd had enough and decided to catch the last bus home . Sure as hell I wasn't going to endure a very long walk or an expensive taxi ride in order to catch the end of this vanity project And I made the correct decision because when we discussed the movie the next day everyone agreed on one thing - None of us knew WTF it was about . It's never revealed who the rabbit people were or who the weeping woman was , though I would hazard a guess it was possibly someone who spent £4.20 for a ticket to watch this garbage which I can honestly say is the worst movie I have ever seen in a cinema . I wasn't all that keen on the last movie I saw in a cinema - OUTLAW but at least it had a story no matter how contrived and underdeveloped Nick Love's screenplay wasINLAND EMPIRE may work as a drug movie ( The audience were suspiciously quiet as in they might have been smoking a certain brand of tobacco that can't be bought in shops ) or as irony in that the writer /director is called Lynch which is exactly what I wanted to do with anyone who financed this rubbish . People may defend the movie by saying it's an enigma wrapped up in a mystery but take it from me it's excrement wrapped up in manure
INLAND EMPIRE exemplifies everything I hate about cult films. It's a shining example of the 'Emperor's new clothes' syndrome, a lengthy, supposedly artistic production that ends up being absolutely worthless on account of its obscure plotting and almost entire lack of reason, sense or purpose.It's a truth that when it comes to writing books, it's very easy to write something that only you yourself understand and identify with. Getting something to appeal to the masses is a lot tougher. Well, the same principle can be applied to film, with the result that David Lynch makes films that appeal to him and others in his little group of right-minded friends. To be honest, I'm flabbergasted that he found funding for such a pretentious outing.Laura Dern plays an actress who finds herself becoming mixed up in the alternate reality of the movie she's appearing in. Or something like that, anyway. There's lots of wandering about in dimly lit rooms, sub-plots and sequences that seem to have little bearing on the supposed plot, and a whole lot of boredom. In fact, this is one of the most boring films I've had the misfortune to sit through. It's as if Lynch goes out of his way to alienate most of his viewers.I certainly won't be in a hurry to watch any more of his work - aside from THE ELEPHANT MAN, which I remember being very good.
Fact # 1: Lynch is a genius and one of the very few filmmakers who have reached the point of image-perfection (others include Terence Malick, Kim Ki-Duk, Herzog, but also Wong Kar- Wai and maybe Nic Roeg)Fact # 2: I found Mulholland Drive completely comprehensible; in fact it is my all time favourite film (together with Kim's Bin-Jip), with Blue Velvet close on its heels and Lost Highway a bit further down the top 30. I saw MD 5 times the week it came out.Fact # 3: I *never* walk out on a film *ever*, but watch the thing till the very last closing caption.Fact # 4: After a considerable time of viewing Inland Empire, I glanced at my watch (bad sign in itself), saw we were 2 hours in and so had 1 more hour to go. I didn't hesitate, but got up and out of the theatre.Tons have been written about this film, so I'll keep it short: Rabbits dates from 2002.What do I mean by that:1 - The fact that it's utterly incomprehensible (well, maybe not totally, but hey) does not bother me, nor the fact that it's artsy - even though I think Lynch should stop meditating.2 - What *does* bother me is that he does not seem to be able to choose. He discovered the hand-held camera. Cool. He's created the most cut-up story ever. Cool. But (a) somehow he doesn't seem to be able to combine the two; (b) he seems to have little confidence in it himself. Some of the shots work, like the dancing scene. Some shots work with the hand- held. But sometimes he uses his old filmic language with the hand-held, and it DOES NOT WORK. It gives the impression that what you're seeing is actually the evolution that Lynch's style has undergone in the past 5 years, without him being able to take position. Emblematic to that problem is the fact that Rabbits-parts are included, which include Mulholland Dr actors, and which dates from 4 (four!) years earlier, filmed in his "moving painting" style.In short: I had the impression that Lynch has evolved, and that this would have been a great film if he'd been honest to himself and keep only the radically new bits, instead of keeping everything in, leading to an inconsistent hodgepodge.Maybe it's telling that in last year's DVD-issues of Lost Highway (or was it MDr?) he actually *explains* part of his storytelling technique. For a master of the non-explaining, this is an omen. Lynch should burn his old pellicule and start from scratch. Try to amaze himself with something he doesn't already understand.
***** SPOILER ALERT!!! ******* Lynch's latest moved me tremendously. I was a big fan of Mulholland Drive, and as one poster here asserted, that earlier film helped me to "dissect" this latest Lynch masterpiece. Lynch himself might think it improper or "uninteresting" to discuss what this film conveys, but "Inland Empire" is such a significant work of art it seems criminally negligent not to, its depth and honesty as profound as it is.In every case Lynch portrays women's sexuality as powerful and without a shred of judgment, even if they are promiscuous, or prostitutes. Lynch acknowledges life's consequences, but without moralizing in any way. Laura Dern's actress character is a true heroine, an everywoman and bold protagonist.The character watching the TV screen throughout the film is the actress in the first version of the film being remade by Dern and Justin Theroux. That actress was killed making the film, by her jealous husband after he discovered her affair with her co-star, and she now sits in limbo, crying from sadness and guilt (another theme in recent Lynch films, brilliantly realized in the fever-dream death hallucination of Naomi Watts' spurned, suicidal starlet in Mulholland Drive). The film was never finished or remade because it was subsequently thought of as "cursed", and the odyssey of Laura Dern's character purges that curse.After consummating an affair with Theroux ("watched" by the suspicious, jealous eyes of her cold, threatening husband). Dern becomes haunted by the suffering spirit of the murdered woman, and all women judged and abused for their sexual choices. I loved the scenes with the women who slept with the actor, comparing notes - and with a real sense of solidarity, there is no cattiness or competition between them, they even admire each other's breasts. They are also stuck in a cramped limbo, their yearning embodied in their hip-swinging, yet robotic and joyless "Locomotion" boogie.Dern's dark odyssey is her experiencing the actresses' pain, the women's collective pain  which she seems to choose to do, her character constantly revealing determination, strength, purpose. And the women heap their burdens on her, trusting her to save them. There are so many examples of this  the Mary Steenburgen character talking about a "debt that needs to be repaid" by the man who lives in the strange little house, the Japanese street girl confiding in Dern's dying character about her junkie/whore friend with the monkey, the strange confession of Dern's white trash woman who climbs the stairs. It all concludes with Dern's suffering a horrible, lingering "death". Then, triumphant at the end of shooting the film, she refuses to accept the kudos directed at her, her victory incomplete if just for herself. She "rises from the dead" to find the first actress in the room watching the events unfold and kisses her, as if to say, "I have endured this and now you are free". The woman's face brightens, she ceases crying, and reunites with her husband and child. Then, during the marvelous closing credits, Dern is celebrated by all the beautiful women, who are now dancing quite joyfully, as she sits on the sofa, beatifically observing the fruits of her efforts as the women sing about "POWER".Dern is portrayed as almost Jesuslike in the themes of sacrifice, will, compassion. She willingly endures an odyssey of horror that leads to her "death" to save them all, whores, unloved wives and spurned starlets alike.David Lynch is a tremendously sensitive, soulful and brave artist, who is just getting better and better. He understands that its not enough to just tell a story, he has learned to make us truly "feel" the story. Three hours was necessary. The bunny people are there, just like the homeless man/monster of Mulholland Drive, to set the stage for a suspension of the laws of logic and linearity, to invite absurdity and magical unrealism into our awareness, so that we can experience pure emotions like a sense of triumph, catharsis, compassion, empathy, unconstrained by the expectations imposed on us by conventional narrative. This movie made me cry, it made me feel so much! What an achievement. Bravissimo David Lynch!!!
Bug Crawls (2008) *** (out of 4) For whatever reasons, filmmaker David Lynch has mostly been making shorts over the past decade and this one here certainly has his dark style written all over it. Basically we see a small house. We also see a bug. We see the bug slowly walk up to the house, walk over it and then fall off. That's basically everything that happens in this four minute short but if you're a fan of Lynch then you're probably going to enjoy the madness that is here. There's certainly nothing ground-breaking here but I enjoyed the dark nature of the film and the fact that you keep waiting for something "more" to happen and it actually never does. I'm sure many people would view this and ask what the point was but I think fans of Lynch are going to enjoy anything he's done and the people who will be most entertained by this are his fans and especially those who enjoyed his earliest short films.
"Bug Crawls" is a 4.5-minute black-and-white short film from 2008, so this one will have its 10th anniversary next year and for writer and director David Lynch, it is a bit of a return to his roots as (b&w) short films are how it all began for him decades ago before he became the shooting star he still is today. In this one here we have exactly what the title says, namely a bug crawling over the screen that is filled by landscape and a house. I would say that the sound effects early on are perhaps the best aspect about this really short movie. It fits the general weirdness of Lynch's approach to filmmaking I guess, but lets be honest: There is a reason why this is a contender for the man's least known work. It is just nothing special at all really and I am sure without the big name attached to this project, it may be almost completely forgotten by now. It's famous (if you can even say that) because of Lynch, not the other way around. And I have to give it a thumbs-down. Not recommended.
David Lynch has dabbled in the realms of many artistic mediums; as a matter of fact, he originally didn't intend to be a filmmaker and was instead mostly focused on being a painter, but one day I suppose he wanted to see his paintings move which led to his early "classic" horror animation "Six Figures Getting Sick Six Times" a semi disturbing avant- garde piece that reminds me quite a bit of his much later short "Bug Crawls". "Crawls" feels to me like a melding of Lynch's earliest and latest work, in particular his cryptic first shorts (ex: the aforementioned "Six Figures..." as well as parts of "The Alphabet" and "The Grandmother") and his equally, if not more cryptic recent works (ex: sections of "Inland Empire", practically anything else from Davidlynch.com, and "Twin Peaks" 2017, episode eight in particular, as well as anything featuring The Convenience Store). Lynch himself has said that this film is nothing more than a mood, and, admittedly, it's more of an art piece than a film. Like, I can imagine seeing this at the MoMA (in which case it'd be among it's better pieces I'm sure, and don't get me wrong I love going there but there's just some modern art that is really pathetic) more than I can a film festival. Either way, it's still creepy as Hell and a brilliantly haunting, atmospheric short that will appeal mostly to Lynch fans and anyone deeply interested in experimental art and cinema.
David Lynch has unfortunately only really been making short films for most of the latter part of his career, which has deprived us of the man's knack for fantastically weird feature films. This one, like many of his shorts from this period is no more than a dark tone. In it, a large bug slowly approaches an ominous looking house set in a dark, bleak landscape. It crawls over the building and then enters it. There is truthfully little to this one other than a snippet of something strange. It is very reminiscent of Lynch's other recent experimental shorts. I can't say I am a huge fan of those or this one, although it is short enough to be an interesting enough watch, with its odd feel and ominous sound design. Essentially though, there isn't much to see here quite honestly.
It's condescending to tell people they don't 'get it', and it's narrow-minded to claim anyone who loves it is pretentious. I adored this new Twin Peaks, and I understand why it's divisive.In his old age, an artist had a chance to throw a kitchen sink's worth of ideas on screen, under the banner of his old show, with complete creative control. Good on him I say! That creative control means many of the aspects which came from others in the original show are missing.I was compelled from start to finish. I appreciated its slow rhythms, found the pacing hypnotic. I'd understand why many fans would despise its new form. I wouldn't blame them for it.If you're after a fully-resolved, tightly-plotted, didactic storytelling, you won't get it. You'll be frustrated by scenes which suggest the story is kicking into high gear in traditional Hollywood ways, only to then be presented with a five minute shot of a man cleaning a floor.This jarring approach... loose ends, unresolved plots, ambiguity and odd pacing are understandably annoying for many. It does lack the melodrama of the earlier series, but there's still a warmth to many of the characters, you are just less guided by music and tight plotting. It's a feat to me that it is somehow utterly absurd yet simultaneously feels more grounded, but this show is not going to tell you a tight story with a guiding hand.Personally, I haven't received this feeling from any US cinema in the past few decades, and I love it. Twin Peaks The Return gave me space to let my mind wander in the same way an Apichatpong Weeresthekul film might. That's a very personal thing, for me it's not boredom, it's a space to imagine and open my mind.There's a lot of hyperbole surrounding David Lynch but his works are the summation of his very clear influences, like any other artist. You can see it all very clearly, and I happen to share many of his loves, so it's exciting for me. Here it's the usual Cocteau, Anger visuals, noir and 50s stylings, but there are clear nods to everything under the cinematic sun, from Jacques Tati to Tarantino and early silent cinema. I loved that, it feels like a celebration of cinema!The tone jumps from humour to horror in a heartbeat, each episode is jarring in barely-cohesive ways but for me, somehow it coalesced. The show feels liberated, free of expectation and cliché. It put me under a spell, certainly not because I was instructed to by critics at large but because together, all these disparate elements felt refreshing.I don't think it's a puzzle to be solved, I don't think there's a bullet-point explanation to the story sitting in a locked vault. I do believe the broad intention was to make you think, imagine and question what you're used to being fed by TV and films.Would I watch it if it weren't called Twin Peaks and weren't by David Lynch? Yes. Should it have been called Twin Peaks, and is it kicking fans in the face by doing so? Very likely. I think that's what makes it so anarchic and brilliant. I also fully understand why many wouldn't want that from Twin Peaks.
If you don't know anything about the original 1990s predecessor, I can't imagine what you'd be doing here, so let's skip all that introduction nonsense.The new "Twin Peaks" is out, and you're most likely an old fan wanting to know what you're in for. Is it the same as you remember it? Yes...and no. Lynch, ever known for his weirdness, is no longer operating under the wing of ABC network interference this time around and has been given full creative control for these 18 episodes. As you can probably expect, Lynch when he isn't being reigned in is Weird with a capital "W", but unfortunately for those fans looking for more of the same old "Twin Peaks" you're used to, Lynch isn't serving up that. Oh, the main players are all back and the town still has a neat local dive with some dreamy musical acts, but this is a bigger story in terms of scope and vision.For one, the series is not confined to the town of Twin Peaks and features many characters in different locations. As for the tone, Lynch obviously saw the opportunity to go all out on his weird style with no one to reign him in, and go all out he does. This is bad news for those expecting a traditional, linear plot to unfold, but great news for those who loved the more surreal aspects of the original series.There are long, drawn out scenes of dialogue, or sometimes just actions. The pacing is often slow and deliberate. The insanity of the original series finale comes to the fore and gets served up in heavy doses. If the original managed to pull in some viewers for the murder mystery despite the quirky aspects of the series, this one disregards those fans altogether by refusing to throw them a bone. Oh, there is a story here, but it's no longer centered around a marketing campaign masquerading as a murder mystery and it isn't going to be told in clear and cut A to B fashion. You have to either be willing to follow Lynch on where he wants to take you or give up in frustration and part ways. Because in terms of differences, that seems to be the main one here: Lynch is doing this his way...and you're either with him or not. This doesn't make it easy on traditional viewers, and I fully expect them to be out once they get to the end of the premiere.Me, I am loving the fact that there is nothing else like this on TV. The same could be said of the original when it aired, and it's shocking how much changes and yet stays the same considering we're 25 more years along and it still takes David Lynch to serve up something truly unique on television. What have these other guys been doing? My boyfriend watched an episode of "Sense8" when I was finished watching the premiere, and the difference in what is passing as entertainment today felt like I had gone from a pristine environment with "Twin Peaks" to breathing in pollution. This is the perfect antidote for someone tired of having their emotions led and manipulated by TV shows that tell you exactly how to feel and think. It's not going to cater to you or babysit you like a child. If requires patience and imagination, and for those willing to stick with it, the results can be so rewarding. Think of it as a purge from all the derivative crap we watch without even realizing how banal it is. Because it takes watching this new "Twin Peaks" to realize just how mediocre our "hit" shows really are. I look forward to being cleansed once a week for the next few months.
When someone works hard at something or does something for a long time you can surmise that they well eventually get good at that thing, even masterful. Generally, this is the case for all great directors and David Lynch is no exception. With the newest Lynch-piece we are given something that is an amalgamation of all his previous work without sacrificing his style or creativity. We see the dark-industrial vibe of "Eraserhead", the American suburbia and the dark underbelly late-night bars/clubs/people from "Blue Velvet", "Wild At Heart", and "Twin Peaks", the winding roads and nightmarish features from nearly all his projects specifically "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Drive", and then last but not least, we see the venture into the digital age with non-linear story and the craziest sound design you may possibly experience in any piece of media that we get from "Inland Empire". There are even remnants of design that hearken back to his old shorts. This folks, is Lynch's swan song. The Return is already like nothing else ever before on TV and this includes the original two seasons of Twin Peaks.Lynch allows the material to breathe, and gives the viewer plenty of time to absorb what's on screen. The filming is patient, and every shot is most definitely taken with care. The slow yearning shots is what Lynch uses to draw you in. The unfamiliarity of new faces leaves you with more questions than before. Also, as most already knew going in, The Return is set in many different locations--not just that charming, wholesome town of Twin Peaks. Even knowing Lynch's filmography there are moments that still have me unprepared for the amount of visuals and sounds that evoke nightmares. More terrifying than 90% of what I've seen as a film-goer.I have to admit that it is taking me some time to adjust to the new vibe of the series knowing well in advance that Lynch and Frost have stated that The Return will be more like the prequel movie FWWM. I am someone who prefers the film to the series because Lynch had more room to work toward his vision. The result is a surrealist nightmare that The Return will have beat by a landslide. With that said, there will be many of you who will not like this at all (even folks who enjoyed the original series because The Return is THAT different). Lynch is certainly an acquired taste and everything isn't for everybody, but for those of you who are willing to give it a shot and appreciate an artist in his top form then maybe there is still some redeeming qualities in this for you. The Return is no run-of-the-mill action series or soap opera so be ready for one of the craziest rides you may ever be on.
A quarter of a century after it ended, Twin Peaks gets a season 3. That in itself is part of the weirdness of Twin Peaks; it's not a reboot, or a remake, it's just ... season 3, picking up just where season 2 left off. No one but David Lynch would do that. I suspect whether you will love or hate this series return (and people seem to do one or the other) will depend on what you liked about the original Twin Peaks. If you liked the quirky soap opera aspect of things in plot threads like the lumber mill, well, this might not be for you. If, like me, your favorite scenes were the really weird ones like the hotel scene that began episode 2 and the amazing scene of the kid and the creamed corn, and if you didn't understand while people didn't appreciate the utter brilliance of Fire Walk With Me, then you'll probably like this.The series begins with the weirdness turned up to ten and the eventfulness turned down to zero, as though Lynch is saying, yes, I made Twin Peaks, but don't forget I'm also the guy who did Inland Empire. After a while the Inland Empire aspects thankfully become fewer and there is more of the quirky humor of the original series (as in a scene with cops try to track down a key to an apartment), actual story and character, and Lynch's typical approach of painting a placid surface and then showing the rot underneath. And some of the old elements of the series, like a weirdly ageless Kimmy Robertson as Lucy and Lynch as Gordon Cole, are every bit as fun and funny as they were in the original.At times full Lynchian madness flares up, like the a-bomb test episode that thrilled some people and that annoyed others, like me. Other times, Lynch shocks everyone by actually offering detailed explanaions of some of the mysteries he has raised in the original series and Fire Walk with Me. At times Lynch seems to be saying, "here's a sensible answer to that thing you've been wondering about for years, but before you get too happy here's another unexplained weird thing to replace that."I wasn't as fanatic about Twin Peaks as some people. I didn't find the pilot especially interesting until funny, eccentric Dale Cooper appeared, and without Kyle MacClachlan I probably never would have watched the second episode. I didn't fully love the series until the incredible weirdness of the second season, and that love didn't last long since the show quickly spiraled into a disastrous mess. That may be why I enjoy this third season and Fire Walk With Me; they represent David Lynch giving me the aspects of the series I love without all the boring soap stuff.Some of Twin Peaks is hugely annoying, other parts are utterly fascinating. Overall, I found it very entertaining, and if it's not everything I want (after 4 episodes I rated this 9 stars, but at season's end dropped it to 8), well, that's David Lynch.One final note. I've seen several reviews saying that the only people who like this series are "hipsters." This is the silliest critique I've ever seen. I'll admit I don't know much about hipsters except they wear funny mustaches and churn their own butter, but my guess is hipsters are not all people who like to watch a revival of a series they don't remember starring a bunch of people old enough to be their parents. Just a guess. No, you silly 1-star reviewers, I'm not a hipster, and I'm not, as some have suggested, a "paid reviewer" (although if someone can tell me how to make money by writing IMDb reviews please do so). I'm just someone who likes David Lynch when he's very weird but not tediously, incomprehensibly so. And that's what, for the most part, Twin Peaks the Return gives its audience.
Possibly one of the best TV dramas ever, "Twin Peaks" managed to return in a challenging and unique way It is bizarre (not to mention intelligent) piece of television that has returned again with putting the pieces of puzzle together..Lynch introduced the first two episode in typically enigmatic fashion, recalling the tall trees which envelop the logging town-setting for Twin Peaks' supernatural mysteries.Original cast members Kyle MacLachlan, who plays FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper and Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer), reprise their roles, while new additions include Naomi Watts and Laura Dern.In short, the new episodes are completely unlike any version of Twin Peaks we've seen in the past, and that's what's so exciting. This is no retread; this is something new. After you've seen the show for yourself, I'm guessing it's all you're going to want to talk about. It's going to be a wonderfully nightmarish summer. Music again plays an important role in establishing Twin Peaks' atmosphere with Portland, Oregon band The Chromatics contributing to the soundtrack.If you get a chance to watch Twin Peaks now, and I highly recommend that you do, it may seem strange that such a show was ever on TV at all. This is because most of television is so bland and boring and repetitious while TP is fresh and original and effective.  Daring and provocative, it shattered the boundaries of most standard soap operas/TV dramas.There are great characters sprinkled throughout, my favorites being:Leland Palmer, and of course Coop, but really they're all interestingTo finish, one needs to watch that 90's version of show. It's not uniformly brilliant and sometimes just plain weird, but always rewarding and truly one of the landmarks of American television. Go get a nice piece of cherry pie, a cup of coffee, take four days off work and start watching it. Then watch how this masterpiece unfold..
After 25 years, Twin Peaks is back on the air. This revival is one of the most hotly anticipated events in entertainment to come along in a long time, and I think that many fans might not like this revival. This is not the goofy, bright Twin Peaks of the 90s, nor is it the bleak depressing Twin Peaks of Fire Walk With Me. This is something new. In fact, most of the first episode does not take place in Twin Peaks, with the people we know and love. When it does cut back to the titular town for a brief scene here or there, it is actually kind of jarring, as we feel that we are watching a completely different show. Nor do there at first appear to be any elements connecting the new central plots to Twin Peaks. I imagine that many people will be frustrated by this and maybe even quit watching, which is a shame because as the show goes on it gradually ties these things in to the main plot in a way that is very satisfying. So despite a rocky start, by the end of the second episode I was on board.I hope that people give this revival a chance. It really starts to come together in the second episode, but I think people's expectations might blind them to how brilliant this return is due to how unexpected many of the elements are.
What a fascinating case of mass self-delusion this has been. It's truly amazing and disgusting how heavily people are stroking themselves over their ability to force themselves to choke down something that is so very poorly executed just so they can reach that oh so "clever" hidden story within.Look, I know that it must be very comforting to keep talking down to people about how they just don't get the weirdness and complexity of it all (because WOW, use of metaphor and non-linear storytelling in the video medium? UNHEARD OF!), but that's really not the problem here. It's the absolutely abysmal pacing and structure. Yes people, we get it. Lynch likes to pull the same old thing out of his bag of tricks that he always has, where he tries to artificially induce unease by drawing scenes out well past their welcome, except instead of the handful of times spread out across a 2-3 hour movie we are now treated to 45/60 minutes of this filler in each episode of an 18 hour saga, leaving very little room for any actual worthwhile content. You don't need to be a mathematician to see that the ratio between the two is incredibly uneven. But OK, yippee hooray for ARTISTIC INTEGRITY! He has such complete free rein to spew out completely unfettered streams of consciousness that no one at all will dare to tell him that maybe things like having a confused old woman talking to the police about who has the keys to a door for 10 straight minutes is an absolute waste of film, and none of you will dare admit that this pile of slop is in dire need of editing because you're too busy preening about what an artistic genius Lynch is, and how open-minded and avant-garde you are by extension for being able to wrap your heads around a plot that's literally been done a hundred times before in superhero comic books. A big slow clap for you all.
Lynch is amazing, Lynch this Lynch that. Everyone is so desperate to love David Lynch I don't think they are watching the balls he's making. are there any reviewers that like this without creaming over how amazing David Lynch is? what other TV series does that happen with? where the guy making it can just do a load of nonsense, star himself in it, make it weird and everyone thinks it's genius.This isn't genius, the first two series were great, although it lost it's way a bit. But at least it had a goal, a story line. Which is just lost in this series.There's too many story lines that mean nothing, they won't reappear later and make sense of anything, they are there for no reason, dozens of characters you'll never see again but you wast too much time watching them think about something. each episode has 5 minutes where an awful band sing a song.. that's it, an awful band sing an awful song for 5 minutes. every episode. that's a tenth of the whole show watching a bad music video. it's ridiculous that you have to watch a 9 inch nails advert for 5 minutes before moving on with the show..Kyle Maclachlan walking around aimlessly got boring very quickly... how they persist in this the whole serious is beyond me. it's boring, the jokes are the same. Apart from that... there is some good stuff going on, a couple of clever story lines and interesting developments, enough to carry on watching, but there's just too much filler to make it anywhere near on par with the original series
Although I've not enjoyed very much of The Return (with the exception of the exceptional Mitchum brothers and their female associates) I've done my very best to like it. To try to accept and understand it, but I find myself failing at that. Jeffries as a tea pot, an hour-long episode of a nuke going off and 15 episodes of Dougie. It's just a bit much to me. Throughout, there's just not very much to like about it.It's like a friend of my told me after a few episodes. The original series was quite an ordinary show, with an odd artsy twist to it. The Return on the hand is nothing but odd and artsy, and that's why it fails to capture me. There's nothing much to relate to anymore. Nothing much to make me care about the faith of the characters or their world(s).As for the ending, I'm quite disappointed with that as well. The idea of fate resetting, with new pieces but the same evil pulling the strings, is good. However, I feel that Lynch/Frost failed to deliver it in any sensible way, much as the failed to deliver anything in a sensible way this season.I loved the original series. The cast, the characters, the story, the atmosphere. I don't think I'll ever learn to love this show the same way. I'll keep struggling with it though. In a few years I'll have watched 3-4 times, and maybe I'll see it under a different light then. I really hope so. But I don't expect to.
I haven't seen anyone this convinced of and enamored with his own ego and perceived greatness since I read Norman Mailer's "Of a Fire on the Moon", which was an equally dreadful experience. It's once and for all clear that David Lynch is the Donald Trump of film making. But of course you have the usual sycophantic fans gushing over everything Lynch does, smugly patting themselves on the back sneering at people who just don't get it. You could have Lynch farting into a xylophone and they would be convinced that it held the key to the meaning of life. I talked to a colleague who loved this new season and when asked why said that it was so subversive to the medium of television. Fair enough, but so was Andy Warhol's "Sleep" and "Empire" to the medium of film, but I would dare anyone to call them good movies. I even doubt that this season was made by people who have actually seen the original Twin Peaks. It's like someone heard of the original Twin Peaks third hand and now is trying to tell you the gist of it in a single tweet stretched into 18 hours of television.And this is not nostalgia talking. I rewatched the original Twin Peaks immediately before taking in this new season, and it's by no means a masterpiece. Not even the first half, like a lot of people claim. It's melodramatic at times, and plays off the farce elements too much for my liking. Little did I know that the (alleged) comedy would be even worse in this new season. This little exchange between the semi-deaf Gordon Cole and Albert Rosenfield sums up the comedic sophistication of Lynch and Frost:
 - I would really like to get back to this fine Bordeaux. - What kind is it? - 11:05
There's your genius, ladies and gentlemen.But, and this is a big but, the original series had characters who, for most of the time, spoke like normal people, and at least the semblance of a story. The characters may have been quirky and not the sharpest tools in the shed, but at least they weren't mentally retarded to the point that even the concept of a mobile phone is so mind blowing to them that they fall off a chair in fear. In 2017, mind you. The characters in this new season are virtually unrecognizable, and I'm not talking physically. Everyone sits stares, pauses, and say their lines like they are pumped full of Valium and starring in a hostage video. Seeing Hawk, Lucy and Andy sit around a conference table talking about chocolate bunnies like they're in a coma, was painful to watch. And Kyle MacLachlan stumbling around like a child for hours in oh-so-hilarious scenes where no one around him behaves like normal people, was nothing short of torture.To call this new season slow is like saying that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are untrustworthy. Slow doesn't even begin to cover it. How about spray painting shovels and watching a hooker get dressed in real time? How about silent shots of a highway in the dark for minutes? I'm actually surprised and a bit disappointed that Lynch didn't show Cooper and Laura/Carrie driving from Texas to Washington in real time. Fingers crossed for season four.Let me sum it up:
 - Just because it's slow doesn't automatically make it profound. - Just because they pause ten seconds between each line and Lynch holds each shot ten seconds longer than it needs to be doesn't automatically make it art. - Just because it's incomprehensible doesn't automatically make it well written.
This new season reminds me of two things.The first is how John Lennon after learning that an English teacher made his class analyze Beatles lyrics, wrote the lyrics to "I am the Walrus" to be as nonsensical and incomprehensible as possible. "Let the f**kers work that one out", like Lennon said.The second is a short film I made as a lark with some a friend some years ago. We cobbled together to most random things we could imagine, everything from religious imagery to scenes out of a porno for good measure, of course in black and white set to pretentious music. Our goal was to see what kind of reactions we would get if we passed it off as an art house film. You would not believe the cockamamie interpretations people came up with.I am convinced that Lynch is trolling everyone.The emperor is not only naked. His concept of clothes is a flamingo vomiting to the beat of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumblebee".A demented octogenarian p*ssing himself for 18 hours straight would have more meaning and entertainment value than this pretentious garbage.
A few years ago I rewatched all of the original series, having not watched it since its original broadcast. Doing this reminded me how creepy, engaging, and effective, it was, but at the same time just how I didn't care for the many sections in S2 where it is soapy and disconnected from where my interests were. The Return starts in the space that interests me most, although at the same time it seems to be deliberately trying to shake off anyone not willing to go with the darker and more disturbing elements. The first two episodes offer no respite from weirdness, disturbing imagery, unsettling silence, and violent moments. It was two hours which had me wholly focused on the television, but yet with the sense of it pressing on me and making me uneasy.This continues throughout the season, although with more balance. At times it is slow; at others it is a dizzying overload of ideas. Characters and moments and ideas connect back to the original series and the to the prequel; but at the same time there are frequent characters and moments who seem to be stand-alone and it is okay if we don't know them. As a narrative I was held by it even though it spends so long doing nothing, and has elements which don't ever get resolved or connected to much else. The tone is a lot to do with this working, and Lynch's constant presence feeds a great sense of darkness being just below all of our sunny lives. Elements of the writing are extended too long, and I think even those that liked the Dougie Jones arc (including me) would concede that it was too much to take almost the entire season to deliver it. That said, Lynch builds around this very well, with plenty of colorful characters, and increasing connection to where the rest of the show is happening.This place is one of dark violence, spirits, unseen worlds, death, and yet it also has time for some characters from the show, and plenty of broad and odd comedy. The mix works very well; much better than I expected. At times the storyline tests patience, and then it will throw in a section or episode which throws loads more on the table and leaves with plenty to think about. I'll not pretend to understand it all, or to get all the references, but I enjoyed not only the watching, but then reading the fan forums to get help with all the connections and reference points. The cast seem to be entirely on board with everything that is being done, and this adds a lot to it – but essentially it seems Lynch got full support to do whatever he wants, and this is what makes it so engaging. Technically production standards are very high, but it is the sound work that really sticks with you – the space, the hums, the unsettling nature of all of it.As a total product it is bewildering, frustrating, exciting, confusing, engaging, and annoying. There is plenty to dislike, but overwhelmingly it delivers a great mix of the dark, the absurd, the cheering, and the mystifying; all with plenty of style, tone, timing, and patience.
David: Hey Kyle, what about playing again Agent Cooper in a totally plot-less sequel of my hit series Twin Peaks?Kyle: OK, David, but I am busy with other projects...David: No problem Kyle. In this series the main character will be Gordon, you know the FBI agent I play. He'll be the superstar, because he's much more interesting than Cooper and anybody else. This time Gordon will also be a chick magnet, with lots of women half his age flirting with him...Kyle: OK David, if you think that will work...David: Of course it will. Gordon is so interesting and irresistible. Not like that wimp Cooper.Kyle: Uh... OK... but as I said I don't have much time...David: No problem, your character will have only very few lines. In fact he's not in most episodes and when he is, he'll be catatonic. You'll just repeat the last words pronounced by the character you're speaking with and that's it.Kyle: Does not seem an interesting angle...David: There will also be the evil doppelgänger, with slightly more dialogue, but not too much. Don't forget that this series is about Gordon: His Return to Twin Peaks.Kyle: Uh... OK David - your audience love whatever you do, regardless... and I can focus on other projects, since this requires minimum effort...
This really is an 18-hour movie. From beginning to end, it's the same pair of writers, Mark Frost and David Lynch, the same director, Lynch, and the same cast in the same production telling one very long story. That it was released in individual episodes on Showtime makes little difference, I think. It's also my favorite piece of storytelling from the entire franchise of Twin Peaks. The first season is good, but its adherence to a pretty much dead genre, the primetime soap opera, limits my enjoyment of it. The second season has a real dip before ending strong. Fire Walk With Me is very good, but suffers from the hope that it would spawn further movies. This return is a go for broke attempt at creating the combination of quality character based storytelling and weird mythology that made Twin Peaks at its very best.There's so much to go into this in terms of story beats, as you might expect from an 18-hour long story with over two hundred speaking parts. At its most basic, this series is about FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper returning from the Black Lodge where he's been held prisoner for twenty-five years, BOB in the body of a Dale doppelganger trying to stay on Earth instead of returning in exchange for Cooper, and the events around them that lead them back to Twin Peaks, Washington for their final showdown. Along the way, we see returning faces from the original show like James, Big Ed, Norma, Deputies Hawk and Andy, Lucy, Gordon Cole, and Arthur. We are also introduced to a bevy of new characters like Richard Horne, William Hastings, the Mitchum Brothers, and Janey-E Jones. We also get introduced to new elements of the mythology like the Eyeless Lady, Judy (who might be the Experiment), tulpas, and the Woodsmen.There is a lot going on in this show, and like much of Lynch's work, there's a strong story that undergirds all of this. Well, there are several stories that all end up converging towards the end. For those who liked the original show's look at quirky characters, we have our regular look-ins at the denizens of the little Washington town and their lives like Shelly and Bobby dealing with their daughter and her scummy husband. On the other hand the film is alive with Lynch's typical brand of abstractions that color his stories. The most prominent of these is Part 8, but I'll get to that in a minute.So, Dale Cooper gets sent back, but Bad Cooper knew this day was coming and created a tulpa, a copy of himself, to try and direct Cooper into the tulpa rather than the doppelganger body BOB currently inhabits with a hit team standing by to kill Cooper in the tulpa's place as soon as it happens. Cooper is a sign of hope and life in the decaying world of Twin Peaks, so he easily evades the attempts. However, there's a twist. Cooper in the place of the tulpa is like a walking baby. He needs to be pushed in every direction anyone wants to go, even to the bathroom, and Dougie, as the tulpa is known, is one of the joys of the series. His innate goodness and positive effects on those around him is like a warm blanket. He barely knows what's going on, often just repeats the last few words of a sentence he hears, and follows signs from the White Lodge around to help guide his actions, like when he chooses slot machine after slot machine that each give him a jackpot in the Silver Mustang casino, owned by the Mitchum Brothers. This gets him on the brothers' radar, especially when they hear from Dougie's co-worker at Lucky Seven Life Insurance that Dougie was responsible for the brothers losing out on a $30 million settlement on a fire at one of their building. Through Dougie's innate goodness and help from the White Lodge, he scribbles on some insurance forms that convinces his boss that the $30 million was incorrectly denied, which gets the Mitchum Brothers to love Dougie and stay with him through the end of the story. It's kind of a pure joy to watch it all unfold.The opposite of Dougie is Bad Cooper. Everywhere he goes he spreads chaos and death. Matthew Lillard plays a high school principal, William Hastings, who was having an affair with a librarian while they investigated "the Zone". Bad Cooper arranges for Hastings to be framed for the librarian's death, then kills Hasting's wife with her lover's gun just because. He arranges for the murder of people with whom he's completed his use just because. Where Dale/Dougie is a force of good, Bad Cooper is a force for evil. The film would be less interesting if it were just those two forces against each other, though. The two never actually meet. Instead they influence the world around them in different ways, essentially moving pieces on a board in a chess game that Bad Cooper seems well aware of while Dougie barely knows how to get out of a car.Through the film's first sixteen and a half parts, I found the action easy to understand. There was a lot going on in a lot of different places with a lot of different characters, but it was easy to imagine everything coming together in the end. The exception to the flow of action was Part 8 where Lynch sidesteps the entire story to give an origin story for the evil haunting this world of Twin Peaks. After a few minutes showing the weird way Bad Cooper returns to life through the help of the otherworldly Woodsmen, the action jumps back in time to 1945 and the explosion of the first nuclear bomb in New Mexico. Told in a purely cinematic mode with no dialogue and only image and sound, we watch the explosion from afar, zoom in steadily, and see the explosive force from the inside. We see the oft-mentioned convenience store suddenly come alive with the presence of the Woodsmen in a violent and scratchy manner. In response to this, we see inside the White Lodge for the first time where the Fireman creates the seed that will become Lauran Palmer and sends it to earth in response. We jump ahead a few years when the Woodsmen reveal themselves to the world and the seed becomes a frog-moth creature that finds Laura's mother Sarah and crawls into her sleeping mouth. Now, it took me a few minutes to write this but it takes the film about 45 minutes to show, and it was glorious. I loved every second of it. My wife, however, hated every second of it, preferring the idea of a two-minute literal explanation rather than an extended cinematic treatment of the idea that conveys as much a feeling, probably more so, than just another piece of the overall mythos puzzle of Twin Peaks.And then we get to final part and a half, and the film moves beyond the basic story we've been following, and it makes no effort to hold the audience's hand along the way. Cooper, fully awake in Dougie's place, takes the old key from the Great Northern Hotel and passes through a door, leaving behind Diane, his old assistant, and Gordon Cole. He gets transported back in time to the events of Fire Walk With Me where he rescues Laura Palmer from her fate, but she vanishes as he leads her through the forest, and we cut back to the present day to see Sarah Palmer still anguishing over her daughter's death, even more so in that moment. He then finds himself back in the modern period, without Laura, facing Diane again, and they must travel 430 miles until they will go...somewhere else. That somewhere else is never explicitly explained. After they have sex for murky reasons, Diane disappears, and Dale finds himself in Odessa where he finds a woman who looks like Laura Palmer whom he takes all the way up to Twin Peaks and everything is wrong, including the fact that Laura's old house is owned by some strange woman who's never heard of Sarah Palmer.Now, the thing about Lynch is that focusing on the literal is often a mistake. There's a clear emotional connection he's trying to make through his abstractions, so the ending, despite its complete lack of real context, ends up working and doing what it's supposed to do. Bad Cooper is gone. BOB has been punched into oblivion by an English kid with a gardening glove permanently attached to his hand. And yet what do we want? We want these weird powers to make Laura alright, but Dale can't save her. It seems like he can change some of the circumstances of her death, but he can't prevent it. When Dale and Diane pass into the other place (our world instead of the "world" of Twin Peaks?) and they find the woman who looks like Laura, she's not Laura, then who is he trying to save? We had our elation at watching BOB finally die, but we can still feel a certain emptiness because Laura, the good girl abused endlessly by her father possessed by BOB, is still dead, and Dale should do something shouldn't he?The movie ends with no real answers to these questions, leaving a lot up to the audience to sift through, and I really appreciate that. It's packaged densely in the final hour and a half with little explanation, but I think the emotion is clear. I've heard and read more interpretations of the ending that go in depth about the presence of Judy, the Palmer house being the center of evil, and more, but that kind of exploration of mythos isn't what really draws me to this story.This feels like a capstone, perhaps the more traditional form of the word masterpiece. It is the work of a master that sums up his body of work at the same time that it stands alone. The culmination of Twin Peaks and Lynch's film work, The Return is a gloriously entertaining extended adventure that looks at the idea of loss and comes away sad. It examines evil full on and makes us uncomfortable. It embraces warm humanity and fills us with joy. It's a massive, complex work that I look forward to revisiting at some point in the future.And one final note: Albert is the best.
With respect to viewers sharing and viewing this piece of work as masterful and being enthusiastic about it, I couldn't have the same opinion after watching it, most of the time with lowered volume throughout the episodesI agree that some scenes are very intense and interesting, but, when you have constantly weird acting (and weird doesn't do the word justice), unbelievable scenes with completely illogical output, crazy music and soundtrack that are skating on your nerves and extra annoying sounds in all decibels coming from characters and events, then please understand and agree that a normal person cannot and won't hold for a long time.The person will feel craziness ramping all over his/her mind while having eyes popping out of their sockets with the lips either tightly pressed or mouth half-open in disbelief and shock.It was that hard to follow and finish it, but nevertheless I did it, because I rarely leave a series or movie halfway.Recommended only to "special" viewers, which according to the reviews are present in the dozen.
It's finally here! And the first 2 hour episode of season 3 is an absolute joy to watch. When the original series aired, i was in my early teens, but i could still enjoy the show. I might not have understood all that was going on, but as it turned out, neither did anyone else.This was the magic behind Twin Peaks, it had no conclusion, like ever. It's the everlasting chase or hunt for something, that is never found. And once the murderer was revealed in the original series, the viewers left the show quickly, it wasn't suppose to be revealing. People watched it for the mystery, and apparently this mystery could have been stretched for 10 seasons, and people would still have been glued to their seats every time a new episode aired. The show was that captivating, more so than almost anything ever aired before.This was so different from anything else back then, no one had ever dared to make something like this, almost not even with movies. Actually the show was intended to be just a TV movie, but the people that saw it went ballistic, so they decided to make 7 episodes to air. But then the show exploded in popularity and got 10+ emmy award nominations and suddenly the show became insanely popular.It's kind of a mystery how, it was definitely not a show made for everyone, but still, it ranks as one of the best shows of all time. Why? What was so special about this show? Well you could probably line up 10 professors and movie experts to try and explain it, you would probably get 10 different answers.So here we are 25+ years later. The first episode of the new season has just aired, and i am thrilled. This was an absolute joy to watch, and it captures the essence of the original series really well. You can tell that Lynch is all over it, he has total control. And just as you would expect, it is bizarre, weird, mystical, scary and incredibly entertaining. And i have no idea what so ever what is happening.When i saw this first episode i thought of Quentin Tarantino a lot and how great he is at setting up conversation scenes with lots of tension, like the pipe scene at the beginning of Inglorious Basterds. Which is one of the best scenes in all of movie history.Here in this first episode you have this kind of tension in almost every scene, and the people could be doing anything. Eating donuts, checking voicemails, deliver packages, watch TV, have sex. Whatever, the suspense is with it all the way, and i have no idea why, because i have no clue what I'm watching. It's just there.This is one of the things that makes Twin Peaks so special, you are just along for the ride, no matter where it takes you, just enjoy the moment. Let it embrace you, it is what you want it to be. And this show does this better than any other TV show in history. The new season is apparently no exception. After the first episode I'm sold, when the song was performed at the end of it, while we see many of the original cast come together, that just sealed it for me, what a way to continue the saga. Absolutely brilliant film making.I can't wait to see the rest of it, this is quality.10/10 first episode - Masterful
"Twin Peaks" and this re-boot of the series on Showtime is a program for select audiences only. Those who consistently watch the show love it and many might try but not stick with it because there is so much strange and surreal content. This isn't a criticism...just that it's a show that would tend to have polarized reactions since it is so unique and strange...which isn't that surprising considering it's from David Lynch.The program picks up 25 years after the original series. Many of the original actors have returned, many have not (and several have died such as Bob and the Major). So, I am sure this had a big impact on how they wrote the story. And, this would probably explain why so far so little of the story is set in Twin Peaks but in places like New York City and South Dakota. It's every bit as weird as the old show and the main plot involves the activities of the evil Cooper doppleganger as well as the real, but incredibly brain-addled Cooper who has just magically returned from that weird red room.Overall, it's well directed and acted. Episode 8 is one in particular that will polarize even dedicated viewers as it seeks to explain the origins of Bob. I didn't care for it...a friend of mine thought it was one of the best episodes. Regardless, the show is incredibly original, strange and is hard to stop watching...at least for me.
If you're not a fan of David Lynch then you're not going to like this show. End of story. Unless you've watched and loved Lynch's movies like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire, then you're not going to like The Return. This is hardcore Lynch, challenging for even his biggest fans. I wouldn't call The Return a sequel to the original Twin Peaks. It's more a sequel to Fire Walk With Me than anything else, with a few elements of Twin Peaks sprinkled in. So, if you're just a fan of the original Twin Peaks and you're not familiar with Lynch's work, then The Return is not for you. You're not going to like it, I can assure you of that.This is ARTHOUSE TV. It's not a murder mystery like the original. It's a hardcore surrealist midnight movie style psychological horror. And while I love it because of that, I can see why some people hate it.
Not like the first TP, or Fire Walk with Me. This is sheer nonsense and no rhythm: unbearable, charmless and humorless, with countless new characters and confusing plots that do not connect with each other. Ridiculous dialogue and too much Actors Studio Method also aggravate the nightmare. The action does NOT occur in Twin Peaks. It is a surrealistic and abstract collage of images that lack consistency. What nonsense is this of a zombie for protagonist? All this "symbolism" is agonizing, pseudo-sixties. What sounded at first like a great idea - to reinvigorate an icon from the '90s - has not returned what it was permissible to expect.
The David Lynch and Mark Frost revival brings back the show without the restrictions of network television as a single 18-hour movie split into chunks and (I'm currently 4 episodes in) all end with a different band performance. Yes, composer Angelo Badalamenti has returned and the nostalgic Twin Peaks theme is intact with a slightly different credit sequence, the mill replaced with the Red Room's curtains.Doppelganger Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), must return to the Black Lodge in order for the real FBI agent Dale Cooper to be freed from his 25 year slumber. But things are completed with a third Cooper (also MacLachlan) throw into the mix. While all of this is going on, other events are transpiring in New York guarded building where a mysterious large glass box has sprung to life and killed its watcher. In South Dakota, a severed head and a headless body have been found and all the various narrative threads have yet to come together in any fully coherent matter.Off the top of my head the majority of the cast return, those actors who have since passed on even show up as manipulated archive footage, notably Major Garland Briggs (Don S. Davis) floating head, David Bowie's Philip Jeffries' character is mentioned. Who knows who else will turn up. Some have passed on since filming the latest series and are acknowledged in the credits including the posthumous appearance of Catherine Coulson's The Log Lady and Miguel Ferrer, who played Albert Rosenfeld. Those who don't return have simply fallen out with Lynch and their reasons are well documented in the press.Lynch has created something just as fascinating as the various directed predecessor and what is most striking is that quirky tone of the old series is recreated without merely forcefully copying it (as the recent X-files tried too hard to do). Lynch is on form here and it's just as weird as ever. The mix of crime thriller with elements of surrealism, odd humour, soap opera outlandish off beat acting and supernatural horror is as effective as ever. If you're left flummoxed - that's the fun, because you're probably meant to be.Twin Peaks helped shape much of the modern television landscape and this latest addition is great looking with surprises, thrills and chills - season 3 is an artsy must see.
Quite simply, I loved the original TP. I even like most of David Lynch's work, although not all of it. But in watching this, all I can say is, DL, either go BACK on your meds, or get OFF of your meds-- whichever is making you think that this crap is worth watching. If it gets renewed, I'll know that you obviously have the pictures of some studio boss somewhere, with a kid and a dog. And you KNOW what I mean.The ratings? Want to amuse yourself? All those haughty 10-star ratings, saying "if you don't get it, well, go watch some drivel someplace?" Click through and look at the OTHER ratings from those folks. Oh, wait...almost NONE of them have, wait for it, any other rating or review--ever. And that one review is for TP 2017, as it happens. You know, all these years, I've never really believed in the big Paid Reviewer conspiracy/meme that's been all over the Net--but I do now. All these inexplicable 10 ratings, for a show that is simply dreck--and wow!--all these raving fans of auteurs everywhere, have ONLY decided to review ONE SINGLE SHOW? C'mon...paid reviews, anyone? I'm surprised, IMDb--you're owned by Amazon, and I'd have thought you'd have tumbled to this by now, as you've banned it on the Mothership site. The show is simply unwatchable. I've tried, I have, but the myriad criticisms leveled by other reviewers here are accurate--the show is slowed down to beyond boredom level. In ep 7, Lynch runs film of a guy sweeping up a bar, for TWO MINUTES, after which, the bartender answers a phone call and has a cryptic convo about 15-y.o. hookers. Two minutes? Then we have this ridiculous discussion between Henry Horne, and Ashley Judd, wasting another 5 minutes, in her office, chasing some "hum." The nonsense with Dale Cooper being a Zombie? We watch him stumble around, monosyllabic--not even knowing how to pee(??)--for WEEKS? And nobody takes him to a doc? Nobody notices that he acts like he's had a stroke? His domineering wife doesn't domineer him to a doctor?The whole "symbolism" shtick is simply agonizing. The psuedo-60's- trippy "let's see someone's consciousness" stuff is, well, 50 years old. If I see one more distorted-convo crap, I'll shoot my TV. And, of course, Lynch HAD TO put himself in there, as Deaf Albert, which wasn't that damn amusing originally, much less now. What a SHAME. I was dying to see this show...now I'm dying to never see it again. It's simply horrible. I literally cannot see any sane studio exec in charge of properties greenlighting this. I'm sure it sounded like a great idea--who wouldn't think so, reinvigorating TP, right, the cultural phenom of the 90's?--but this is NOT what anyone expected. The only thing that this has to do with TP is ripping off the same characters and same actors. Even the shtick--like the ever- idiotic Lucy--is old and tired. Watching Lucy flip backwards in her chair, because she's "scared" that the Sheriff walks in, while talking to her ON the phone, after a quarter century of cellphones? Oh, come ON. Lucy was naive, and sweet, and not bright, but she wasn't a moron.Enough. DL, retire gracefully from the field. This was an egregious misstep.
David Lynch deconstructed and re-imagined the original series as the fantasy of a schizophrenic (Richard), who for 17 episodes fights his way back to reality, attempting to cure himself in episode 17 by reversing the death of Laura Palmer (i.e. the raison d'être of Agent Cooper, aka one of the two major fake identities, Richard's good side that has previously just defeated Mr. C, aka Richard's evil side). Although he finally wakes up in episode 18, by the episode's end he suffers a breakdown and collapses back to the dream/ schizophrenia, and the series ends with the image of him in the lodge and Laura Palmer whispering in his ears. With 17 episodes of David Lynch-ian dream-world, the series makes for a heavily unballasted watch. There's no beginning and no end, just random events occurring and random characters appearing and then disappearing. The sedated pace doesn't help, nor does the abundance of cheap-looking cgi. Twin Peaks: The Return is the ultimate act of arrogance of an old artist (Lynch is 72) who is way past his creative prime (his last good work was 2001's Mulholland Drive), and who isn't afraid to tarnish his legacy by meddling with past masterpieces (i.e. the original Twin Peaks) but ends up falling flat on his face in the process. TP3 is a sketchy, swollen, boring, rambling work that repeats themes that have appeared in his previous films, but in a vastly inferior way. Were there good moments along the way? Sure. The atomic bomb episode, the arm-wrestling scene, the moving performance of Rebekah Del Rio, bits and pieces from the last two episodes, these were all worthwhile moments, but they got lost in an incoherent sea of terribleness. Let's just hope that this is the last we see of Twin Peaks, or indeed of David Lynch.
David Lynch claimed that it was a mistake to reveal the murderer in the first seasons in Twin Peaks and that he had rather left the question unanswered. This worries me when seeing this series now, when he is in total Control. There's no question that he is a very able director. Previous films has shown this (not all of them though). What worries me is that he has found out a very cheap trick and is milking it for all its Worth. Why do we find detective stories or who-done-it stories so interesting? Well, that is what nourishes our minds. Lynch found out that we can keep the interest up for a long time if we pose intriguing questions. When we then fail to deliver any sort of answer will not mean much, so Lynch seems to have thought, I'm afraid. If so, then what saved him Before were the producers that did not allow him a director's cut and insisted on some kind of answer. I hope this is not the question with the present series. Intriguing questions have been posed in abundance already and although they are also visually intriguing, I'm afraid that is not enough if that will be all. I hope this series will not end in a magnificent catastrophe, but so far I cannot tell. The real brilliance is not in the question but instead in the answer, even if it is insufficient. The answer Always shows you where you stand and where you are heading. It may be naive but it is Always honest.Well, my worries proved to be correct. There are no answers here at all, not even naive ones. The catastrophe is now a fact. Lynch made The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Wild At Heart. That's impressive. Especially the first 2 films are. Then he discovered something about the human psyche and how it is drawn to mysteries and used it in Twin Peaks in the first 2 series that, in a way, are just as bad as this one. The answer brought in the final of series 2 was a pretty desperate one, a twenty-five cent answer to a million dollar question. With this series he does not even provide the twenty-five cents, which, in a way, is kind of cheap.
Just saw all of the nineties episodes. This whole debacle really started with the last episode of season 2. It didn't make much sense and the over all quality was really poor. Now, after 3 episodes, I am baffled. Completely nonsensical story to put it mildly.The dialog ,so far, is absolute gibberish and incoherent nonsense. I have taken pride in being able to watch just about everything at least once but no more. This might be the worst she*t ever televised!
The original Twin Peaks was surreal yet great and you could at least follow it. This.... I mean we're they off the planet on LSD or something making this? Awful. Leaves far more questions than answers.
There's always a great chance that sequels aren't going to be as good as the original and this is yet again another fine example how it usually goes.The earlier two seasons raised the bar so high that it was only going to be inevitable that the third season was going to be weak.In the first two seasons there weren't many unreasonably violent scenes and there was no sex at all. After all, great show doesn't need cheap tricks at all to work. Same can't be said of the third season which makes cheap tricks another form of art.In my opinion the decision of not playing the hypnotic music in the background was a great mistake. Nowadays directors don't even know how to use music to enhance the experience and yet again, it's no surprise that Twin peaks without the catchy music isn't quite like Twin peaks at all. All what's left is the theme that is played on each intro.It's not my Twin Peaks anymore.
Pure art. The ants clearly represent ants, and for the cheese, it's obviously a delicate allegory for cheese. The zoom and the inverting colors however, they ment to show the anxiety of upper middle class white men in a gender normative workplace mixed with the Nietzschean hopelessness of the world without God.
Here we have "Ant Head", a black-and-white short film from 2018 and the most recent filmmaking effort by lauded director David Lynch. It runs for slightly over 13 minutes and shows us an artificial head with glaringly big eyes and mouth filled with ants. That is basically all there is in terms of what you see. Towards the end, they reverse black-and-white, so it slooks slightly different. Early on you hear music, but with the change in looks, there is also a change in audio as they now came up with something like a very hectic radio broadcaster that speaks about as fast as the ants move inside the head. Shape of anything related to the head is not changing whatsoever from start to finish. i would be screaming too if my head was full of ants. Well no, I'd be dead probably. Anyway, you could say it is typical Lynch, reminded me style-wise of some of the other short film works he came up with recently and that seems to be his most prolific field of expertise nowadays and yes I know he just continued Twin Peaks, but still. But overall, the quality did not impress me at all. The way the left and right side of the screen stay unchanged from start to finish does not feel too creative either, at leastg if keep in mind what happens in the middle is not exactly breathtakingly exciting to watch. For all I care, this film should have run for under 5, preferrably under 3, minutes. Only for hardcore Lynch completionists. Everybody else should skip it, even at this running time, it dragged so much. Highly not recommended.
"Fire (PoZar)" is an American animated short film that was released very recently, slightly over two weeks ago, and this is the newest filmmaking effort by David Lynch. After his new take on "Twin Peaks" is finished, he keeps dishing out new short films the way he has done so many times during his career. This one here runs for slightly over ten minutes and is a pretty diverse collaboration because Lynch, who not only wrote and directed here, but also drew the characters himself, got help from a Japanese animator and an Eastern European composer. I liked the music quite a bit. It has the typical gloomy, mysterious approach you find so many times on Lynch's works. Obviously, even if this is animation, it is not the kind you may want to watch with your kids. Not really because it is that scary, but because they will have no clue what's going on and most likely even be bored by a film this short. Admittedly, it is pretty difficult to understand the action here and the title is not much of a help either. The fire is one of really not too many aspects that are easy to identify. So I gotta say that I understood more about this film by reading the plot summary here on imdb than by watching it. Nothing new with Lynch though, who is in his mid-70s now already. There is always a mystical, maybe even mythical, auro to his works and this one here is no exception. One thing that crossed my mind is that it shows us a scenario in which a new danger comes to light and could even be apocalyptic, so I wonder if this is maybe Lynch's take on the current Corona situation. Oh well, probably not. I assume that he started working on this one much earlier and not just two months oor so before the release, even if it absolutely not a long movie. So I said I liked the music, but that is almost the only thing I liked here. The animation style is not a preferred choice for me. This is entirely subjective. Others may like the retro touch that is to it. Honestly, if somebody had told me this was made in 1920 and not 2020, I perhaps would have believed him if he had made said statement with determination, competence and self-confidence. It looks this old for sure, not only because it is in black-and-white. So yeah, I wwas kinda glad that this film ended so quickly. Gotta give it a thumbs-down here and while it is not among my least favorite efforts from Lynch, it is also nowhere near my favorites and I cannot recommend it unless you are a Lynch completionists. If so, then don't expect anime or anything here only because of the Japanese animator's involvement. I guess I'd rather see Lynch himself again and perhaps some monkey. That was more fun. Final note: You can watch it whatever languages you (don't) speak. It says English here on imdb, but there is no dialogue.
Whatever those adventures were - if real or imagined, conscious or subconcious or not visible, as usual with David Lynch - I liked it. I know I won't
hit Lynch's exact ideas and we can all have different interprations for the work (it's all valid he says) but my take on Alan R's adventures is one of
uncertainty about the things of life with this strange head repeating and affirming that he's not gonna fish today. That might be true, after all the face
can't move at all except for the mouth and there's another character on the side who doesn't respond to him. Maybe Alan is the one waiting to be fished this
time, I mean he stuck there doing his insane act, fighting for certainty, all is well and good but to be certain of one act alone isn't an affirmation at all
if one does not act upon it. Wait...I was supposed to help guys and gals.So, that was just one take from this very good filmed art by the genius creator of "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet" - just to name a few - and whenever Lynch
breaks a little from the "normal" path of movie characters, always coming to deliver an experience that is more about to think first and feel later, he can
generate confusion, hatred, amazement or enlightnement. As with life, it's tough to understand but we keep insisting; his films may never explain anything
but the toughest of us keep on insisting too. Why? There's always something there to be explored, analyzed, looked at in a different way and the more
you exercise your mind and heart to it the less frustrated you get and the more in love for the experience. I could be putting those thoughts in any of his
movies and it'd apply (not so much for "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story" since they're on a more natural level. It's for all audiences, world cinema
at its best). And don't forget: with time, you can't always look back at what you didn't understood when younger and with life, films, books and other
experiences you can get a little closer to Lynch's puzzle. It's all there for us to fix it, put it together and imagine what the final image will be like.What makes this short a little strange and lacking in appeal is the time. Sure, for those being introduced to his films it's a great to get a minor
comprehension of the artist, to create an impression and then move on to his longer films. I felt a sense of greatness and enjoyment while watching but
when it came to time to rationalize it, or feel it more intensively it got something lost. What was funny wasn't later on but that's just me.It was an
adventure though not in the traditional sense. After all, if Alan R. can have fulfillment just by lying there without a body and repeating what he won't do and
the figure next to him doesn't complain or support him (just staying silent), I guess we as audiences can't judge much what the other side is expressing. It's all valid and we try not
to be so severe or critical of things. It's complex, difficult but it's worth the challenge, the headaches for some. Lynch always makes me come back even when the
experiences isn't all that great or memorable. Maybe 10 years later I'll understand what this was about. Check it out! 8/10
Of course, this tiny building block, which at first glance seems completely meaningless, self-serving, and infantile, may make sense in 50, 100, or 1000 years, placed in context, and then we will be amazed at the genius of the creator who made us some grandiose and overwhelming masterpieces out of tiny mosaic cubes. It may be so. I will not rule out this possibility. Until then, however, I will keep my reverence for myself, for I do not like to be enthusiastic without an actual reason to be enthusiastic. And when someone builds the significant part of his career essentially on the fact that your deifying fans will project some meaning into a plethora of foggy references and inadequate handrails, I think that's the right attitude.On the other hand, I don't deny that I'd be happy to see the many little puzzle pieces finally come together into a huge, held-up middle finger that scoffs the many salivating hypocrites who glorify these audiovisual jokes, but unfortunately my life span is probably too short to wait for an artificial intelligence to waste its precious time solving such nonsense.
A spiral descent towards the hell, disguised as a pseudo-religious mirage, that we call Hollywood. [Full review in Spanish]
A film just as much about Hollywood as it is about the viewer trusting their skills as a motion picture dream detective, Mulholland Dr. is a rare kind of masterpiece.
...a black mirror in which the audience see whatever they want; a noir thriller, a history of Hollywood, a LGBT drama...
David Lynch's gloriously specific and frustrating masterpiece still stands as an unparalleled, idiosyncratic work of cinema
A hypnotic masterpiece.
A beautiful, gripping fever dream. Loaded with haunting imagery and a star making performance by Naomi Watts, this is Lynch at his most accessible...without compromising any of his artistic vision.
It seems that the 21st century began with Mulholland Drive. [Full review in Spanish]
Delving into Mulholland Drive can be like falling into a rabbit hole. Yet it's a journey that has kept me fascinated, perplexed, and enthralled with every visit.
With Mulholland Drive, the trance that comes so easily to him is finally charged with the doom of a classic.
If, in the end, Mulholland Drive is too clever by half, no matter. Lynch's superb command of mise en scène makes his images and situations their own reward, rendering even the simplest gesture creepy and imbuing any innocence with evil.
David Lynch's genuinely scary Hollywood horror film...
This is David Lynch's Persona, a pyscho-sexual exploration of memory and identity that is clearly the work of an artist working at the height of his creative powers.
An allegory about the dark corners of Hollywood, what it does to the psyche of those in pursuit of the classic American success story trying to make it big in the pictures.
Lynch understands better than anyone how pop culture items such as old rock tunes and movie musicals are ingrained in everyone's (sub)consciousness, quietly defining people's aspirations and perception.
Though Mulholland Drive does not employ reverse chronology as such, it is about a fundamental disconnect - as David Roche called it - between narration and diegesis.
Mulholland Drive is maddeningly abstract and inscrutable on first viewing, but hypnotic and haunting on every viewing after.
Taking an open ended TV pilot rejected by the networks, [Lynch] added 45 minutes and created closure in a weird, mystical logic that, in its unique Lynchian way, makes a twisted emotional sense.
Knowingly exploiting the tropes and clichés of Hollywood film while eschewing its formal and logical boundaries, Lynch's film strikes at the heart of cinema's power to represent mood, sensation and altered states of perception.
Mulholland Dr is reissued some 15 years after it was released. It was rapidly hailed as the first great US film of the century. None since has been any more powerful.
Luxuriously strange.
Mulholland Drive was interesting for a while. Then it got weird. Then it got pretentious. I've heard some people say that this is David Lynch's most accessible film, but I disagree. I think The Elephant Man or The Straight Story would be better options. Even Twin Peaks made more sense than this amnestic fever dream. It definitely creates a mood, but this bewildering mystery is too convoluted to unravel.
Somehow Lynch has a way of crawling into my mind and leaving me in an altered state. This one stayed with me for a good long while. Truly an all-time classic
David Lynch slowly plays with your mind in this mysterious contemporary Los Angeles crime drama.
What can be said about the film itself that hasn't been said better already?
This film changed my (early-teenage) life. If not for seeing it practically randomly, I likely would not have discovered so much of what I did after. It oriented me on a path toward beauty in a way that nothing else had to that point in my life, and I'm not sure that anything else has, to the same extent, after.
question, what did i just watch??
Highly entertaining, moody, suspenseful film.
I found Mulholldand Drive to be a fantastic film, having loved all of David Lynch's films seen personally so far (personal favourite being The Elephant Man, one of the most emotionally affecting films ever made) with the exception of Dune. For this viewer, Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best films and among the best films of the 2000s, but it is also one of Lynch's most love-it-or-hate-it films- from a love/hate him director- as seen in the reviews here. And it is very understandable why people would dislike it, it is weird (not unusual for Lynch), it is slow, the story mayn't be clear to some, the symbolism may go over people's heads and it does get confusing especially towards the end. And it has nothing to do with not getting it, it is just not for everybody's tastes and not everybody is going to connect with it. For those who love it neither of these are problems, admittedly it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style beforehand so that it doesn't come across as too much of a shock and also to watch it more than once. Justifying what was so great about Mulholland Drive, a good place to start would be the visuals, which are never less than scintillating with bold colours, symbolic imagery and some of the most striking cinematography of any film from this decade. The Silencio Club scene is so beautifully shot. The haunting retro score, thought-provoking dialogue and that it contains some of Lynch's finest direction and the best directing of all the films from 2001 are further things to like. The story is where those who dislike it are perplexed, granted there may be too many plot strands crammed in towards the end and not everybody's going to like how the ending is open to interpretation, but with me the thriller-drama story was gripping and I was captivated so much by the surrealist atmosphere, offbeat emotional intensity and sizzling suspense that the slow pacing didn't feel slow at all. It wisely focused on the relationship between Watts and Harring, and while bizarre it was very well handled. The cast carry the film brilliantly, especially with the sensational lead performance of Naomi Watts who has never been better than here. Laura Harring is enchanting and Justin Theroux is very good. In conclusion, while not for everybody's tastes for understandable (and quite obvious) reasons Mulholland Drive was fantastic in all areas. 10/10 Bethany Cox
Extremely beautiful cinematography combined with genius storytelling and amazing acting.
Mulholland Drive (2001) directed by David Lynch
This is the type of movie you get to see once in many years. It's an experience that feels apart from this world. It takes place in the crazy mind of David Lynch. It's one frenetic, chaotic, silent, suspenseful, vibrant and sexual movie, and that's what makes it so unique.
The story is very complex and filled with small details that help you complete the riddle. This is one of those few movies that by the end I was extremely confused with what had just happened, but was still able to call it a masterpiece. This felt like a fever dream in the most incredible way. It's also cool how I never knew which path the film would follow and that would just make me always want to know what would happen next.
The acting was also pretty dang good. Naomie Watts was definitely the star of the film, but Laura Harring did a pretty good job too. Somehow i really felt like this movie couldn't be done with other cast, which sounds funny knowing what happens in the film.
The way this movie was shot was very unique and surrealistic and created a dream-like atmosphere. The score was also jaw dropping and was able to play with our feelings like it was nothing.
Lynch is an incredible director and I'm looking forward to watch more of his work. It's probably the first director that in the same scene was able to make me drop a tear and go completely bonkers in the next second.
I thought it was fabulous. David Lynch is a truly unique director and I love how his films are different than almost anything else you will find out there. This film is very weird but you will enjoy if you can just roll with it.
The Straight Story is a small motion-picture miracle. How could a film whose high points include a man tasting his first beer in three decades be anything else?
This is the act of forgiveness given the proper cinematic and moral weight it deserves, following one man across the country on a lawnmower as he tries to make amends. You will cry your face off.
Lovely little film with a sweet and subtle lead performance you won't soon forget
It's intriguing to watch the Lynch of Blue Velvet and Lost Highway feel his way toward a less wounding surrealism -- into images that have power to hurt and will do none.
It's unlike anything else in Lynch's filmography, and it's genuinely brilliant.
It seems only fitting that Lynch's most unambiguous, sentimental film should concern a man named Straight and the title is entirely apposite.
It's hard to imagine a gentler film, yet Lynch fully exploits the stately pace to gaze fondly upon life's rich pageant.
Instead, like Alvin, [Lynch's] film sets out on its mission in its own unassuming way and; inviting as those campfire flames around which so many stories have been told.
David Lynch's movie - the finest he has made since "Blue Velvet" - is serenely bereft of postmodern cynicism.
With his sweet, lyrical masterpiece... David Lynch frees himself from the heavy irony and noir affectations of his last few films, discovering the pure, mythical slice of Americana previously confined to Agent Cooper's coffee and donuts in Twin Peaks.
As far as I can see, [David Lynch] simply spotted a great story and embraced it. So will you.
The Straight Story could easily slide into melancholy and sentimentality without Lynch's sensibility, an odd mix of up-by-your bootstraps American conservatism and on-the-road romanticism.
Is The Straight Story one of my favorite Lynch films? Hard to say. Is it one of his most meticulously, and perfectly constructed? Well, I just can't disagree on that one.
look and feel of a foreign film
Great, but young kids may be bored and restless.
Mainstream-accessible yet completely maintains Lynch's uniquely off-kilter artistic identity.
One could say that The Straight Story is a twilight Western on the order of Unforgiven, except that the pale rider here mounts a snail-paced John Deere instead of a stallion.
Coming straight from his Eagle Scout's heart, "The Straight Story" is David Lynch's simplest, most straightforward and most mature film to date.
Farnsworth's easy, twinkle eyed charm is a winner all the way, but it's finally the film's deceptive simplicity and unabashed warmth that make it one of Lynch's most artistically and emotionally satisfying movies.
Lynch brings the movie’s febrile and violent artifice to life in visual compositions of a poised, painterly authority and interrupts them with quick bursts of hallucinatory frenzy.
Behind Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet, it's probably my favorite David Lynch film.
Justifiably off-putting in its simple but nonetheless jarring narrative disorientation, Lost Highway is hardly the empty, superficial exercise it was written off as.
It looks fantastic, it has a wildly eclectic cast, and most of all, its pure, unadulterated Lynch.
Lost Highway, Lynch’s second collaboration with Wild at Heart author Barry Gifford, is all too conscious of doom nipping at your metaphorical heels. It’s a down-and-dirty Los Angeles noir that even James Ellroy would have to look at and say, “damn.”
Senses of unease and menace are soaked into every scene. It is genuinely disturbing in places, adding up to an overall frightening experience that tops close to every horror work of its decade.
A prototypically baffling David Lynch picture...
Beyond subversive and downright ahead of its time.
Strange, disjointed; full of sex and violence.
Here, the road leads nowhere in particular; what you pay for is the ride.
What Lost Highway lacks in originality--compared to the rest of Lynch's oeuvre--it regains when compared to anyone else's films.
Its demented darkness actually coallesces into a strange kind of giddy joy - not unlike the rush of adrenaline one feels after a brush with danger.
It's pensive male anxiety, and for some cultural reason it's easier for audiences to accept female hysteria than the insecurities of men.
Mesmerizing yet cold and remote -- an exotic fish we can't touch.
The film begins promisingly, when a young couple gets paranoid over intrusion into their home, before turning into a bizarre yarn that many viewers will find confusing; even so Lynch's direction is mesmerizing from start to finish.
It's one of the downright spookiest films I've ever seen, and it gives me chills just to recall it.
With the hindsight of Mulholland Dr, the film is a lot more intelligible, with plenty of Lynchian themes in full blossom and a handful of excellent performances.
Director David Lynch, the master of creepiness, is back with a femme fatale film that's sinister, disquieting and deliberately obscure.
Lost Highway is not Lynch at his most accessible, that would be Blue Velvet followed by The Elephant Man and The Straight Story, and I would put those films as well as Mulholland Drive (one of his most polarising along with Eraserhead) as better films of his, but while it has divided and will divide viewers I did love the film. Lost Highway does occasionally get confusing (particularly from a psychological stand-point) as a result of trying to have too many ideas, which does seem to be what the main complaint is against it, but for me there was very little wrong (as a bit of advice it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style first with The Elephant Man or Blue Velvet being the best place to start). Lost Highway looks amazingly stylish, the cinematography some of the best of any film personally seen in a while, the colours are expressive and bursting with colour and hypnotism and the images are surreal but impeccably hypnotising. Lynch's directing is highly accomplished if not quite some of his best directing like Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet. He also does a great job in not making Lost Highway too formulaic (there is a sense that formally and structurally that there was a fair bit of re-invention involved), in fact it was one of the freshest and most unique psychological mystery thrillers personally viewed. Like Eraserhead, Lost Highway is basically an atmosphere/mood piece and it works amazingly as one. It may be Lynch at his strangest but that made the film even more fascinating to watch, no matter what you think of some of the story the impact the atmosphere has in the film cannot be denied. The thriller elements are enough to set the pulse racing and the mystery elements while made obvious about half-way through have a lot of suspense. Bill Pullman's exemplary here, some of the best work he's ever done even, and standouts too are Patricia Arquette at her most sensual and Robert Blake at his creepiest. The music score is incredibly haunting with fitting use of pre-existing songs and while spare the dialogue doesn't stick out like a sore thumb too much. All in all, a bizarre film but with the mood it has and how well-made and directed it is it is a very compelling one too. Not Lynch at his best but around the top end of his filmography. 9/10 Bethany Cox
David Lynch helms two separate but intersecting stories starring Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty, Gary Busey, the late Richard Prior, Robert Loggia, and Patricia Arquette; one about a jazz musician tortured by the notion that his wife is having an affair, who suddenly finds himself accused of her murder
The other is a young mechanic drawn into a web of deceit by a temptress who is cheating on her gangster boyfriend
These two tales are linked by the fact that the women in both are played by the same actress
Lynch involves surveillance technology, doppelgängers, gangsters, an impossible transformation in prison, and murder in his multi-layered narrative 
As per usual Lynch likes to use many of his gimmicks when it comes to filmmaking from fade to black transitions to slow motion to intense music 
It's challenging too since the narrative isn't so straightforward which will appeal to the director's fan base 
It does act as a foreboding mystery, it doesn't really have a resolution but features a lot of surreal imagery 
Lots of gratuitous sex and violence involved 
Plenty of senses of unease and menace soaked in almost every scene making us like the protagonist paranoid and unsure of what's really going on 
Not the most coherent of Lynch's career but stimulating still
An astonishing movie full of the inventive mind bending weirdness Lynch does so well. A movie that stays with you.
Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. To watch this is to be tortured.
Surrealist in the extreme but, to me at least, compelling. I doubt very much there is a clear narrative that can be read from Lost Highway but the undertone seems to be about the emptiness at the sordid heart of LA, or Lynch's guilt complex about his (America's?) treatment of women. Some haunting moments in this film, occasionally undermined by the silliness of the late 90s industial metal (???) used in the score. A stepping stone perhaps to some of his other (better regarded) surrealist stuff, but one that probably hasn't dated as well as he would have hoped.
We've met before, haven't we.
Before finally getting around to watching the whole movie I would always watch "The Mystery Man" scene. Everything from the the audio from the noisy party gets drowned out, like they've entered a separate dimension. The color grading changes as the music goes down when he walks up to Bill Pullman. Robert Blake (The Mystery Man) has no eyebrows or eyelashes. His face, his voice, his laugh. Pure creepy.
David lynch is the type of director who explains nothing but shows us everything we need to know to gasp it's dark and yet deep meaning.
One of Lynch‘s best movies. It's even better after the post-movie google.
David Lynch wrote and directed this weird tale which sees a musician and his girlfriend receiving strange videotapes after that I'm not even sure how to explain it. As strange as the film gets, Lynch has a way of lulling you into the dream world he's created.  Great cast with Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, Balthazar Getty and a very creepy Robert Blake. 
This film along with most of Lynch's filmography requires more than one viewing.
A classic movie, there must be a lot of meaning.
is a joke. What were they thinking
David Lynch's most underrated movie by far, and one of his darkest and most disturbing. Although it doesn't feature any of Lynch's regular collaborators (with the exception of Jack Nance, who appears in a minor role), the cast is absolutely superb, featuring amazing performances from Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette and Balthazar Getty, and of course who could forget Robert Blake as the Mystery Man. The scene where Fred encounters the Mystery Man at a party is one of my favourites in all cinema. It must be said, as well, that the soundtrack is phenomenal, with songs by David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins, Lou Reed, Marilyn Manson and Rammstein to name a few. These greatly add to the effectiveness of this movie. Overall, a dark and disturbing masterpiece that ranks among Lynch's best work.
I love how weird yet well done it is. It's super sexy and artistic in parts and overall a great cult film... not for everyone. I don't mind how disjointed and nonsensical the story is.
Omg what the hell was that all about this movie made absolutely no sense incoherent pretentious drivel
This movie puts you to think a lot. David Lynch is a master of complex cinema. Bravo.
David Lynch’s movies are so slow and boring. I don’t know why people like them so much. I’m halfway through this movie and it hasn’t gotten to any point yet. After they come back from the party they walk around the house for 6 minutes. Ridiculous!
Crazy mindfuck of a movie but absolutely fascinating to watch. Soundtrack is great, but Lynch's filmmaking style really carries this where the performances fall short
Surreal and captivating
It's not among David Lynch's best works, as some might end up confused, but with its signature surreal and dark style it offers a thrilling viewing experience, in a neo-noir crime thriller with a few supernatural and fantasy elements, an unconventional narrative structure, a haunting atmosphere, disturbing moments, a chilling soundtrack and unhinged performances.
Self-indulgent, occasionally boring and entirely nonsensical, "Lost Highway" is a textbook vanity project case. Yes, it's intriguing and has a few engaging scenes and a well-crafted neo-noir atmosphere - oh, and Robert Loggia gives a delicious performance - but for what? It's complex for the sake of being complex, keeps building to faux climaxes, gives you clues that never add up to anything and culminates in a spasm. Which I guess symbolizes Lynch cumming over his own script? Oh, I get it now.
Takes a while to get going, but once it starts it becomes a twisted but special and memorable journey with great performances and another confusing Lynch story. Pretty cool soundtrack too, for the most part.
Slow paced murder mystery of a weird and unusual nature that fully embraces and revels in the strangeness of the situation before ending without making a lot of sense in regards to what exactly it was
Terrible! Thank God for the FFWD button. I guess if you stitch random scenes together in an incoherent fashion, it is considered a masterpiece. The only reason that these movies are rated highly is because people think that there is some deep meaning underneath all the illogical mess. But there is none.
David Lynch is so hard to rate . Almost every time I get to the end not even comprehending what I just saw . One thing is for certain I love his style 3.2. Not as weird per say as his normal stuff but just as abstract and all over the place . I definitely enjoyed the originality . There’s something about a movie you really have to pay attention to and constantly rewind
Filled with lynch's trademark disturbing images & mystery the lost highway has two separate stories that may be connected to the same woman
This is a very typical Lynch film, which is enough to make me love it. The individual parts don't make a lot of sense until the end but it's a fun ride there. My only complaint is that some of the scenes try to hard to come off as cool and it's cringe. Took me out of it at certain parts.
Lost Highway has a perfect first act.
Although it might be too extravagant is really hypnotic
Wonderfully disturbing
Truly entertaining, but it feels like Lynch is trying to find his footing here
Another surreal David Lynch vehicle; Lost Highway is more of a stylish Hollywood art piece than a typical narrative film. For people who understand David Lynch's filmmaking motivations and recurring motifs, Lost Highway is perfect in many ways, but on the surface it's that head scratching night terror you had once where you weren't really yourself and you may have murdered someone but you'll never know for sure what the dream meant.
Great Soundtrack. Ironically, you feel like your on a lost highway watching this. Keeps you watching til the end & when u get there...You're like WTF. There is no solidified understanding of it. You have to theorize on your own at the end & your still confused. Great acting, visuals, scenes but ending was too vague & unclear.
i dont know how or why ive missed seeing this 1997 masterpiece of film making...its slow burn winds into an open mind and stays there, im sure it will, for the duration of my lifetime...Arquette, Pullman, Getty, and Blake all fine performances....Eraserhead, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet, and now...Lost Highway...are such strange, memorable, phenomenally crafted works of apex art and now i savour this new find...and for another moment...i feel alive...feel...good...to be alive.
One of the most underrated works of filmmaker David Lynch and an absolute treat!
Maybe it was too late for a late movie. Though the idea was cool. Lost Highway on a big screen. Never been able before to enjoy the full beauty of it 'cause the version of the '90s was a full screen only.    The movie is all about getting fucked up in the head by constantly falling into a non-ending labyrinth that takes place God knows where. A creepy guy appears all the time. A girl changes her hair colour. Identity lost, killing without knowing, sex, headaches, saxophone, femme fatale, garage, infidelity, prison, cheap porn, cameras, videotapes. Parallel worlds and confusing identity. The impossible definition of us. Nothing can stay the same. The constant movement of time and the effect of it.     Double date for us four that made it to the movie after chugging two pints and taking advantage of the dollar shooters offer on a Friday night at that bar next to the cinema. Two survive and the other two felt asleep. Not that is a boring movie. In fact, I think I felt in love again with the movie. So obscure in all the possibilities. Tense. The film noir. Patricia Arquette offer a tripping performance led by her filter voice. Bill Pullman at his best. Richard Pryor is in too. I forgot about it. Might consider having a rebirth of my childhood relationship with Richard Pryor movies. Brewster's Millions. Purrr.
Pure art masterpiece.
Sort of a gracefully crafted, fuddled mess from the famous director. After a compelling handful of opening ideas, the film dissolves into a series of double identity/femme fatale tropes, complete with gangsters and a Very Sinister Person who is up to something evil, but what that is, we don't know. No offence, but Lost Highway is comic book material! Promoted as something of a major release at the time, complete with t-shirts, press space, and major artists contributing to a movie soundtrack of sorts, Lost Highway really doesn't work in the best Lynchian sense, possibly to do with some conceptual elements that aren't emotionally satisfying or because, possibly Universal Pictures aren't the right company for Lynch and co. Not long after though, he wrote/directed Mulholland Drive, which is easily one of his finest movies - it features similar story elements but leaves a genuine dramatic impression upon the audience.
What a nightmare. I love it
If I didn't know better, I'd say Lynch is trolling us with this one. His random collection of fever dream insanities rings much more aimless than in his best work, and the people who try to ascribe concrete meaning to it come off as pretentious as the movie itself. Still, there are plenty of creepy-cool visuals and engrossing weirdness to be found here: saxophone solo, coffee table death, Robert Loggia's roadside freak-out, and of course Gary Busey.
Psychologically frightening, highly surreal yet demanding of multiple viewings.Here is evidence that David Lynch is one of the strangest and intellectually bravest filmmakers of all time
As a big fan of David I saved this piece for a long time. No special reason for giving it a go now, but it was surely about time. We meet a couple. He is a sax player, I'm not so sure what she does. They live in a big house, are probably pretty rich and have some relationship issues. Not big issues, but some other problems seem to bug them a bit. They get videotapes delivered to they're door step. No tags on them, just films of the house thay live in. They do get scarier as it's made sure that someone is filming them inside they're own house as they are sleeping. This is when both the plot and film takes of and the mystery is taking over controll. Few answers, just a bunch of good looking scenes with frightening music (well, sometimes there's some Marilyn Manson or Ramstein here as well) and a bunch of cool characters. It's not easy to hang on to or to get much out of, but this is a very successful nightmare on tape. "The Mystery Man" surely is creepy and the kind of splitted story is going trough a smooth transition for me. Violent, dark, freaky and open film - perfect to fall asleep too, before you rewind it back to catch up on what you missed. Not for everyone, but something not to miss for fans of Lynch. Not his best of work, but not his worst either. 7 out of 10 tapes.
Driving down the center-line between two roads that are connected yet separate.
What a weird fucking house. It almost resembles the person that lives in it. Lynch's aesthetic is so fucking weird and out of the ordinary. It's really bizarre. It definitely sets him apart from all the other director's. The relationship and connection between the guy and girl are off. There's this creepy vibe that exists throughout the movie. I will say, Lynch's use of sound and lighting is impeccable. Lynch is one of the only directors who can make movie where you don't know what the hell is going on and everything is completely weird, but you're so interested that you want t keep watching. This guy is literally losing his mind. There's this one aerial shot of L.A. around the middle mark of the movie, that I have never seen before that was breathtaking. He really knows how to use unsettling camera angles. It's almost as if the weird white faced guy is the personification of death. I love movies that make you think and this is definitely one of them. This movie's also unpredictable. Although not my kind of go to movie, it was very interesting to watch and try to put all the pieces together. I even looked up an analysis of the movie
I have to say I don't have a clue what it's all about but I totally love it! Will rewatch time and time again.
Black as midnight on a moonless night
One of my favorite movies of all time.
One trip of a movie. Not as hard to understand as other Lynch movies, but I'm sure there are some intricacies that flew over my head. It's a tale about a man who isn't happy with his current life (wife cheating on him, he's losing his virility) and he dreams about being another man, a younger man who is great at sex and has 2 girlfriends. There are some constants between the 2 worlds ie his wife appearing in both, the Mystery Man, Dick Laurent and Ed. In the end, he can't keep up the facade/dream, and it comes crashing down on him (at the end when he suddenly changes from Pete back to Fred. He does actually kill Dick Laurent in real life because that's who he thinks his wife is cheating on him with. That's my general interpretation of it... but there are still many things I don't fully understand. Another theory I liked was that it should be viewed from a Freudian perspective, as Pete is his ego, Mystery Man is his Freudian Id who likes to record actual events vs just interpreting them and who helps him kill Dick Laurent, while Mr. Eddy is the Freudian super-ego who follows and enforces the rules to a tee ie tailgating too closely, and who is a strong enforcer. Everything that happens up to electric chair is real, and what happens after is just a mental projection. Who knows? Regardless it's a fine movie that's open to interpretation, just as Lynch intended it to be. The cinematography, direction and the soundtrack are all amazing. This is a creepy movie that takes the viewer on a wild ride, and which can only be interpreted after watching the movie and looking back at the whole of it. It's an experience vs just watching a movie
Another surreal David Lynch vehicle; Lost Highway is more of a stylish Hollywood art piece than a typical narrative film. For people who understand David Lynch's filmmaking motivations and recurring motifs, Lost Highway is perfect in many ways, but on the surface it's that head scratching night terror you had once where you weren't really yourself and you may have murdered someone but you'll never know for sure what the dream meant.
Time has been kind to David Lynch's impenetrable noir puzzler. Only Lynch could tell you what's going on here: is it the cathartic breakdown of a man whose sexual paranoia is giving him hallucinations? A jazzy riff on themes from 40s films noirs? Whatever, it's intriguing, well acted, strange, well photographed and lent menace by Lynch's sound design and Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score. Don't analyse - surrender.
One of the ultimate works of film-art. This beautifully constructed sense of unease makes you feel a little bit crazy. The body-switching, strange visitors, and other Lynchian motifs are perfectly aligned in their most pure expression here. This is a crazy movie and I love it.
A surreal intriguing tale in Lynch style a film that you can't keep your eyes off of.
To some extent a very stripped down version of Blue Velvet, It bridges the gap between old and new Lynch well, but lacks the depth of his better work.
Great movie. For those unfamiliar with Lynch's love of the surreal, this may be a frustrating film to try and watch and comprehend, but for those who know what he promises in his films, this is a thrilling, bizarre, beautiful film to watch that features trippy visuals, phenomenal style and great performances from its cast, especially Pullman, Arquette, Getty and Blake.
An intriguing film noir that is a nightmare journey through one man's mind--he even says in the film that things are as he remembers them and not as they actually were, whichh set us up for this journey through one man's mind. Beautifully shot and well acted, it is a real treat for those who like Lynch films.
very well crafted psychological thriller mystery.
A classic Lynch film. Could be my favorite
A transitional film for Lynch ... kind of the bridge between "Twin Peaks" and "Mulholland Dr.". It's a film that confounds many viewers because Lynch is essentially making a fantasy film without including any of the genre markers that flag a film as such for the viewer. Hence, many viewers refuse to accept a fairly straightforward and literal interpretation of the film and seek some deeper symbolic meaning that isn't really there. It's quite literally about a guy who cannot accept the ugly truth about himself so he alters reality to accommodate his self image.
Lynch's underrated masterpiece.Tour De Force through wild, angry and infinite imagination
I went to the cinema with no expectations and I was simply blown away. The movie asks you to suspend reality checks and be hauled into a storm of senses and symbols. Lynch is in a sense the American Fellini.
The best Film Noir ever. Heck, this is the best film ever, full stop! Lynch manages to explore the inner most depths of the human mind like no other, producing films that- like good poems- need to be read over and over again in order to gain a true appreciation. In this particular tour de force, Lynch explores issues central to the Noir genre: female sexuality, the idea of the femme fatale, the desire for men to control their worlds and the paranoia that they develop when they perceive that women are essentially out of their control. As with Mulholland Drive, Lynch disorientates the viewer, a technique that serves to place the audience within the disturbed mind of the movie's anti-hero, whose perception of reality has become clouded by his uncontrollable paranoia. Fred Madison: I like to remember things my own way. Ed: What do you mean by that? Fred Madison: How I remembered them. Not necessarily the way they happened. This is a film that I never tire of watching.
l like to remember things my own way Whenever you approach a David Lynch film, you really have to be prepared for a surrealistic, mind-boggling challenge. His films rarely come as an easy pass to answers or entertainment and can even frustrate to the point of absolute bewilderment. Lost Highway is no different and ranks alongside Inland Empire as, probably, Lynch's most difficult film to date. Jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) awakes one morning to find a video tape lying on his doorstep. He and his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) watch the tape only to find that someone has been filming the inside of their house. The tapes appear with increasing regularity, each time revealing more and more footage. This only adds to Fred's suspicions of his wife and her friendships outwith their marriage. Not before long Fred is drawn into a labyrinthine plot with a Mystery Man (Robert Blake), ferocious gangster Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), pornography, murder and teenage mechanic Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) who may, or may not, be involved. Working on the script alongside his Wild At Heart author Barry Gifford, Lynch crafts an experience that truly is a hallucinatory nightmare and one of the most effective horrors I've ever seen. It's a great combination of noir and horror with shady characters, femme fatales and downright freakish oddities and there's an ambience that's classic Lynch with his very unsettling and minimalist approach. The man can craft sinister from absolutely nothing; bare lamps, shadows and vacant spaces speak volumes and he's aided considerably by - regular collaborators - Angelo Badalamenti's foreboding score and Peter Deming's hugely effective cinematography (which was supposedly shot in one of Lynch's own L.A. homes). Some critics have been harsh on Lost Highway, claiming that it's self-indulgent and lacks depth but it's one of those films where you really have to pay attention. Even the minutest detail can be so important to unraveling the mystery. It's a film of two halves and the trick is in trying to piece the two to make a complete whole. The first half of the film is fairly linear but in the second, a metamorphosis takes place that really is a bizarre and confounding plot twist. From that moment on, nothing is as it seems and it just gets weirder and weirder. Only Lynch can get away with this kind of mind fuck. And get away with it he does. It's a hugely involving and complex piece of work. So much so, that you actually question whether you're intelligent enough to understand it at all. Is there a point? Who knows for sure. I have my theories as I'm sure many others do but the beauty in this film is that it's a transcendental piece of art. Does there need to be a point or is it like all other great art, whereby you interpret the voids for yourself. The voids where the artist isn't readily giving you clarity. How it affects each viewer will, no doubt, be different and unique and there's not many filmmaker's or artists out there can still achieve such an impact. If you're reading this review, looking for definitive answers, then you're looking in the wrong place. If I did offer my answers to the conundrum, it would only rob you of your own experience. And anyway, like all great works of art, you already have the answers. The answers that make sense to you. They're not mine, they're not anybody else's, they're yours. And that's what I love about this filmmaker. There's no-one quite like David Lynch and his idiosyncratic genius. One things for sure, it explores the themes of sexual insecurity and paranoia but when it operates on a metaphysical level that's when things get very challenging. You could view it from a schizophrenic angle, it could be an alternate reality, an underworld purgatory or you could be trying to interpret dream hallucinations and suppressed memories. It could be many things and although I have settled on a particular meaning, my reasoning could be entirely different to another's. Put simply, it's open to interpretation and will depend on each and every individual viewer and what they bring to the experience themselves. You just have to open yourself up and embrace it. And therein lies the art. You could argue that this is Lynch's most cerebrally nihilistic film to date and a variation on the same themes explored in Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. Like those films, I have seen it many times and each time I manage to decipher another piece of the puzzle. For years, I couldn't make heads nor tales of it but I now have a better grasp on what (I think) it's all about. However, trying to work it out is not in the slightest bit easy. All I know, is that I love the experience each and every time and sometimes I even question why. Mark Walker
This is pure Lynch. If you love Blue Velvet or Mulholland you will love this movie.
Prepare to be Lost. It makes little sense...but You know what you are getting into with David Lynch. Fun fact...this is the kind of movie that you can turn the sound off, talk to your pal on the phone...and still watch it, understanding just as much of it...as if you were hearing the dialogue. Scratching my head, but not sorry that I watched it.
hmm; not that i've seen very many, but i'm pretty convinced that all Lynch's movies are weird. i like that, though -- trying to find the deeper meaning or whatever is kind of a fun game.
Lost Highway is certainly an acquired taste, but it is a movie that everyone should see just for the sheer singular experience and there's a hidden brilliance in certain scenes that only Lynch himself has been able to out do.
Not David Lynch's best work. It is one of his most interesting, though. The way I look at this film, it's part one of three separate works of his that begin with a story that's coherent and intriguing, only to spiral out of control with symbolism and metaphors. Those other two works are Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. Both of which are much better; however, for the case of this film, what makes this a lesser work to those two is the excessive nudity. There's just too much of it. If it were not for Patricia Arquette's breasts bombarding the audience over and over again, the film would have been able to be taken for what it aimed to be taken for, which is art. No matter how good the first have is--and it is good--it doesn't change the fact the Lynch forgets when to draw line between art and porn.
I have no idea what the fuck was going on in this movie
Was lost most of the time but I can't deny the exquisite cinematography
Is it decent? Yes. Is it enticing? Not really. Lost Highway is a movie that looks like it should be great, and it has many qualities of being great, but it just seemed like it was confusing simply for the sake of trying to be complex. It definitely disappointed me (I watched this movie soon after I watched Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire, two David Lynch movies that I really liked a lot) and it simply isn't as good as it wants to be.
Very underrated. Maybe David Lynch's best movie, as well as most overlooked.
Lynch explores how evil influence plays a macabre role in the corruption of goodness, of everything that is sweet and innocent.
The world of Twin Peaks is dense, terrifying, and seductive all at once. Fire Walk with Me has all these trademarks but also presented the reality that David Lynch will never succumb to audience expectation, no matter how rabid they might be.
Engages with the psychological onslaught of the senses that is stirred by trauma in such a furious, intimate way that... the simple act of looking at a framed image of Laura Palmer can send electricity up our spinal cords.
Weirdness abounds, but is always depicted in Lynch's highly stylized, painterly manner. He loves to dwell on images languorously, whether they are horrific or pastoral.
Twin Peaks: The Return elevates FWWM from a questionably necessary prequel movie to an essential piece of a far larger and suddenly more cohesive mythology.
As hard as it may be to watch, Fire Walk With Me is a beautiful, underrated movie that is essential to Twin Peaks.
Not a goddamn thing happens in this movie. I actively hated it. It made me yearn for the absolute worst episode of Twin Peaks.
Though a disappointment to many upon release, this looks better with the passing of time and the easing of expectations, and it looks forward to the more finely wrought nightmares and mind-warps of Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr.
It's a much needed corrective on many of the show's ethical missteps (or at least shortcuts), and an absolutely essential part of the entire Twin Peaks experience.
David Lynch's prequel film, maligned upon its initial release, can now be seen as a hinge in his filmography - and a hint of what's to come.
An ungainly and unnecessary prequel to the excellent TV series.
A horrible masterpiece. Ugly, abstract and unrelenting, it's like having someone else's nightmare.
As much an essential missing piece for audiences of David Lynch's groundbreaking 1991-'92 television series ("Twin Peaks") to gain closure as a stand-alone film, "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me" is an alternately funny, harrowing, and bizarre experience.
One of Lynch's darkest, most disturbing films precisely because it is able to delve into the places that the show simply wasn't allowed to explore on national television.
In its own singular, deeply strange way, Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch's masterpiece.
A fascinating tightrope-walk: Lynch's ultra-cool unconventional storytelling techniques are modified just enough to allow the movie to reach a broad audience
If you didn't get it then, you're not going to get it now.
There have always been two sides to Lynch: the inscrutable, demonic prankster and the rhapsodic dreamer. In Fire Walk With Me, he's at least trying to recover his poetic sincerity. If only his dreams weren't starting to look like reruns.
At its best, it's a dream within a dream, a nightmare in endlessly reflecting pop mirrors, a screen full of TV-movie sex and horror kitsch blowing up right in our faces.
Fire Walk With Me contains not a single moment of genuinely felt emotion.
Widely misunderstood at the time of its release, Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch's masterpiece, and is rightfully being rediscovered as one of his major works. The film is a brilliant examination at the inevitable corruption of all things that are good in this world, and the capacity for evil inside all of us. It is also Lynch's most human and heartfelt work. It is the best film to ever address the concepts of nurture vs nature, as well as coping with trauma. It's a visual treat and magnum opus that is anchored by one of the finest performances I've ever seen from an actress. Sheryl Lee is soul shaking in this film, and she deserved an Academy Award for her work.
An absolute masterpiece about a tragedy that only David Lynch can narrate us. Please watch this film after the 2 first seasons of Twin Peaks, or you will destroy de (very dark) magic. You will cry, but you will laugh too... Sometimes.
I can't think about a best soundtrack Badalamenti gifted us here. 
This is about the dark and the bad in all of us. Laura Palmer is fighting the evil that only human kind created. 
Is this a tale? Is this a metaphore? You can take it literally or on your way, and that's the wonderful game David Lynch offered us.
You might get dizzy afterwards.
It's alright. I'll always enjoy the red room scenes but much of the other movie did not hit for me. Last 20 minutes were great, the other 2 hours not so much.
If I could give this a zero, then I would.  I would put this right alongside Eraserhead as in completely "unwatchable."  The directing is self loathing, and the movie as a whole has no entertainment value.  This storyline is complete non-sense.  The nude scenes are completely unnecessary and demonstrate pure perversion.  What a mess.  Actually, in comparison, this movie makes Eraserhead look like The Thin Red Line.  It is awful in every imaginable way.  I dare you.  I dare you to watch it.  I would sit through 10 repeated viewings of Cats before watching another minute of this trash.
The movie is interesting on its own. The first part of the movie is very powerful. The second half ( give or take a few minutes) is a bit repetitive and somewhat redundant  particularly after the killer is revealed..  The deleted scenes clarify a lot of the movie as they tie very events together. A lot of its supernatural content is largely unclear, but it's  clearer after watching the deleted scenes. Didn't watch the tv show; likely the tv show will also help.
SPOILER FREE REVIEW FOR FANS OF THE SHOW: I liked seeing the reveals as a fan of the first two seasons, but the show alluded to Laura (the town upstanding citizen) being this awful dark character of a person, and that was enough for fans to understand her. The movie takes you there into those DARK DARK moments, and that is why I hated the film in the end. The raunchiness' and overall disgusting and vulgar very long moments of the film were unneeded. You can allude to all these things, and get the same emotions out of the audience without spending a majority of the film dwelling in the toilet of society. From drug abuse, to prostitution, to rape, the film leaves the viewer with an overall feeling of disgust, and I regretted watching it as a fan. The show has a charm, and it's characters do to. I wish Lynch would have chosen to reveal these mysteries (from the Laura story arch) without having the viewer have to sit and watch every detail. The movie was WAY darker than the show, and supporting characters do not get any screen time to get over their own mystery and charm, which were all major reasons the movie does not appeal to me, a fan of the show. 
Overall, just too dark of a film, and misses the charm of the show completely. The only other complaint, which is far less of an issue, is that the stars in this film are obviously way older than the roles they are put in. That is to be expected, but it does destroy the belief that these are kids. 
I guess, if you love the show, you may want to fast forward the film to get the reveals, but unless you love feeling disgust, pass on watching the film in it's entirety. If you are not a fan of the show, you will have no idea what is going on and the reveals will be meaningless.
Underrated movie: Lynch gave us what we needed and not what we wanted, and it was misunderstood by many. It's mandatory to watch it after Twin Peaks S02, because it stirs up the story. Excellent made movie as always from Lynch.
Sick director, boring story, wasted two hours of my life...
Fire Walk With Me doesn't quite work on its own without context from the show.  That's fine now, during the age of streaming; you can watch this as another few episodes.  The main problem with this prequel movie though is that it doesn't show us anything that we didn't already know about from the series.  While it is interesting to see how the events affected Laura Palmer, it still seems pointless.  It would've been better if the film focuses in more on Laura as an independent character study.  However, the movie also suffers from unnecessary subplots.  The first half-hour consists of two different sequences with characters that have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  It's not all bad though.  For all its flaws, there are plenty of engaging sequences- especially the ending-, strong performances and stunning set pieces and lighting.
The quirkiness and strangeness are off the charts in Twin Peaks and are at such a fevered pitch that the rest doesn't matter all that much.  There is such a thing as ‘too weird' or ‘too quirky' for a full length motion picture but this walks the line between that and going too far and does not go too far and still remains tethered to it's core theme, whatever it is... at least it doesn't go too far for my taste because I still find it to be mostly coherent, which is how I also know that it is still all grounded to something.  People have said that you need to see the television series first, before seeing this, but I don't think that's necessarily true at all.  I never saw the series and I was still able to score this high.
This basically shows everything that was left to the imagination in the TV show, covering the last week of Laura Palmer's life. I love this movie, it's one of Lynch's most disturbing for sure, but it's not his best work overall, functioning better as a companion piece to the show as opposed to a standalone film. Do NOT watch this film unless you've seen the Twin Peaks original series.
Dale Cooper being with Laura at the end when she sees the angel made me cry so so much because he is truly the figure of Goodness that entered her life (although after it ended) to try and balance out all the horror she went through. It's all about love...
I had always read how unsatisfying this film was for fans of Twin Peaks so, despite loving the original show and The Return, it had taken me until now to watch this. Coming into anything with low expectations can be a blessing as I am more often left pleasantly surprised at the conclusion. I should have realized revisiting this town and it's members would always be a pleasure, even if this visit lacked the jocular and humorous tone that gave the TV show much of it's character. I appreciated Lynch expounding on certain elements in this prequel and the insights gained as a result into certain relationships between two or more "people" was what I found most interesting.
David Lynch is out of his god damn mind and thank God for it. This is something I need to watch over and over to fully understand everything but much like the series before it, it is haunting, ethereal, surreal work.
A deeply disturbing yet tender portrait of how existence is torment for almost all of us. Far ahead of its time.
As a standalone film, this is hot garbage. There's no way to sugarcoat it, it just doesn't flow as a movie. However, it's great if you're just treating it as a supplemental piece of material to the show. It adds context after watching the original 2 seasons and it's surprisingly crucial to see before watching the revival season (I'm glad that's the order I went with). But if you're going to do something as a film, it should be able to stand on its own to at least a certain extent, even if it's part of a series. I can't imagine enjoying this or making any sense of this if I hadn't watched the original show.
Essentially important for Twin Peaks TV Show! Brilliant movie!
The days leading up to the demise of Laura Palmer are featured in this prequel film to the TV series by David Lynch. As with most Lynch projects there are moments of clarity where you think you know what's happening and then that quickly takes a turn into a fever dream of confusion. The world of Twin Peaks is filled with strange quirky characters.
A Lynchian masterpice! Fantastic performance by Sheryl Lee.
wow, some of the best performances of all of cinema
This movie is part of a TV series, please don't watch it as a standalone or it would be impossible to understand. Having said that, just one watch has proven not to be enough for me. All I've experienced initially was the fall of miserable Laura Palmer, devoured by perversion nested in her home. Her ineluctable fate draws near day after day, and it's painful to watch her demise as she struggle to evade from her demons to no avail. A second watch unveiled a lot more, hinting many connections to the series and explanations of a few mysteries. If seen as a long episode of the series, it surely shines as one of the most inspired, and the best chance to make acquaintance with Laura Palmer, main character of a series where she barely appears. Painful to watch, but necessary to understand.
My first impression on rewatching Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is that it has just as much, if not more, to do with Twin Peaks: The Return as the original series. Indeed, it seems that with Twin Peaks: The Return, Lynch was trying to tie in the whole Twin Peaks canon, drawing much inspiration from his dark prequel. Fire Walk With Me is starkly without the limitations and censorships of network TV, which liberates Lynch. However, what's missing is Lynch's writing partner, Mark Frost, and you feel this throughout. Fire Walk With Me is a David Lynch feature; a totally different entity than the TV series. Thus, fans of the original TV series were disappointed, even outraged, with the prequel feature film. But some films age well, and Fire Walk With Me is a testament to this. The pure filmmaking artistry of Lynch has never been greater, or more gorgeous, even if we still long for the world we are more familiar with, and are not fully convinced with a story that's missing Lynch's writing partner. It's also Lynch's blackest film, a deeply existential contrast with the quirky soap opera cuteness of the original series. Quentin Tarantino famously said, after viewing the film at its premier at Canne, "Lynch had disappeared up his own ass". I say Tarantino and the rest of the world's expectations back then had disappeared up their own ass, and now that those expectations are long forgotten, we can judge the film on its own merits, which are generously deep. Indeed, Fire Walk With Me has much to offer as a cinematic masterpiece, both on its own terms, and as part of the Twin Peaks canon. Had Mark Frost been involved in the script writing, it might've been more the film fans had hoped for. Nevertheless, Lynch brings us back to a world as only he could; always a ride full of dark, unexpected turns worth taking.
You have to watch the first two seasons of the show to appreciate the movie. It doesn't all work but great overall!
Not for everyone, but although I really don't normally do this, I went and watched this times in the theater once per week.
i actually really enjoyed the movie, if you have seen the two first season and want more i recommend watching it before return. alike most of Lynches works you either need to accept the confusion or take time off work and start wearing a tinfoil hat. the movie fits in with the narative of the series but could also stand alone. however we miss out on a lot of the twin peaks charm such as the smaller rolles and their plots.
Great performance by Sheryl Lee. If you liked "The Return" - it's almost entirely based on this movie
If you haven't seen the TV series you waste your time with this movie. Lynch is a master, of course: the cinematography is outstanding and mesmerizing, the same is for the sound designing and the sound track. But it's not enough: no emotions, no involvment, no empathy maybe because of the acting quite like a B movie. Better forget it!
Painful, Depressing, and Frightening. Fire Walk with Me gives us an in depth look into the last days of Laura Palmers life.
So I've never really been a fan of Twin Peaks (never watched it during it's airing) but due to the cult status it's taken on and due to the numerous recommendations from horror forums, I decided to give it a shot (a year ago). I got through season 1 and couldn't for the life of me understand what the hype was about (though I still rated it a 3*). I forced myself to start season 2, and even though it took over 10 months, I finally made my way through it, still not a fan. All of this was done bc I wanted to see Fire Walk With Me, and those were the prerequisites. And wow, the movie impressed me. It was much darker and much more interesting than s1 or s2. Imo it took the best parts of the show and made a prequel movie from them. It took out the cheesy comedy and replaced it with a layered psychological thriller that had many elements of horror. It was dark and it was beautiful. The story Laura Palmer took on a life of it's own. She went from a meme to a tragic hero fighting (literal) demons. It was really good. And unfortunately you must watch s1 and s2 to get the benefits that the movie has to offer. Or I guess you could read one of the million synopsis' of s1 and s2 that were created for new fans of the show who wanted to start watching s3.
Very bizarre but it is suited to the overall theme of the Twin Peaks universe
It's easy to create a satisfying movie when you have a series as a prior, but lynch didn't limit himself to that, he seted the movie in the past but moved it spiritually beyond the end of the series
A powerful much darker version of the brilliant tv series
As with most David Lynch material, this movie is hard to critique. I enjoyed seeing a deeper look into Sheryl Lee's and Ray Wise's characters, and any material that expands on Twin Peaks' mythology is more than welcome. Normally I enjoy the non-existent plots of David Lynch films, but I felt like this movie really could have benefited from more cohesive plot transitions. This was evident after watching The Missing Pieces and realizing that what was left out was actually crucial information. On a side note the sound mixing quality of this film was horrendous, certain high-pitched sounds were ear-shattering while lower sounds were almost inaudible.
One of my favorite thing in life David Lynch
Fire Walk With Me is an essential chapter in Twin Peaks lore and one of the most visceral experiences of the series.
not really sure what to rate this because it seems if you know the series then you will understand the film, i however didnt. it was so jumbled, random and confusing, it made no sense to me.
After Frost and Lynch's huge television success with the series Â´Twin PeaksÂ´, it was an obvious and logical move to make a theratical version about the unsettling and disturbing life of Laura Palmer, also depicting the darkness luring below the surface of it's citizen in the small town of Twin Peaks. Entering Lynch's obscure universe do require some thinking in order to solve the puzzle. It is a stand alone movie, but I highly recommend the audience to view the first two seasons of Twin Peaks because the story is complex and require some prerequisite knowledge about the interctions of the various characters. The third season should be viewed after completing aforementioned in my opinion. Can I now have a cup of coffee and a pie of cherry pie?
Crazy film in the Twin Peakes universe
The film that ruined and goes to show that you never give Lynch complete creative control if you want a production to be anything other than a postmodern mess
Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me is a masterpiece. And certainly one of the best things to come out of Twin Peaks. The story of Laura Palmer is gripping and heartbreaking. And the story of Chet Desmond and his companion Sam attempting to solve the mystery of a murdered girl, although confusing, is gripping as well. I will not go into anymore detail, go do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
Who killed Laura Palmer
I decided to re-watch Fire Walk With Me, the prequel to the original Twin Peaks (filmed in 1992), to see if it gained anything in light of the recent new series in 2017 (which I enjoyed). Indeed, the first 30 minutes with special agents Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland, was pretty great - with David Lynch as Gordon Cole, David Bowie as Philip Jefferies, Miguel Ferrer as Albert, and Harry Dean Stanton as Carl from the trailer park, all reprising the roles they would play again in 2017 (albeit with Bowie only in flashback). There is a reference to a Blue Rose case and the same haunting and weird atmosphere found in the latest series. However, as soon as Isaak finds the "green ring", that part of the film ends and we enter the story of Laura Palmer, one year later. This is a bit grim, given that the plot revolves around incest, since Bob has entered Laura's dad, Leland Palmer. The ambiguity is that we don't know if Bob exists or if Laura's perception is a result of the trauma she is experiencing. Her drug use and acting out sexually could also be symptoms. Of course, Twin Peaks fans know that Bob is real and now we know more of his backstory (born in the first atomic test?) and we understand that Leland was not acting of his own accord. But that doesn't make the degradation here any easier to take. Those who wish to experience Lynch's haunting world (the music, the sets, the debauchery) can find it here - except don't come into this hoping for the same thrills and puzzles as we found in the last series (after the first half hour, that is).
Ultra-classic, drug induced murder mystery. Slice of cherry pie and a cup of black coffee.
This dark drama is the prequel to the TV series, Twin Peaks, also by director David Lynch. A woman who seems to be innocent and pure by day leads a double life in a rural community where quite a bit of evil lurks just beneath the surface of an otherwise typical American small town. Sheryl Lee acting chops really shine as " Laura Palmer " . Sheryl Lee performance was emotional , crazed , beautiful . Excellent music and mixing . 5 out of 5 stars .
Fantastic film! Even better with the context of Twin Peaks season
I loved the Tv series and couldnt wait for this prequel. On release I wasnt disappointed but was not expecting the film to be as dark as it was. Years later I would watch the film again (prior to the 3rd season) and I was astonished at how good the movie actually was. It appeared to have got better with age and was riveting from start to finish. Sheryl Lee putting in the performance of a lifetime.
my favourite Lynch film forever will be
Really just plain too weird for me, and I liked the first two seasons. The only satisfaction I got from this is knowing what happened to Lauren Palmer from her account. In general, really weird, and at times... Just boring. Solid concept, OK execution.
David Lynch establishes a sinister mood and never lets go. Melodramatic and intensely personal, Sheryl Lee's compelling portrayal of Laura Palmer is the emotional center of the film. Lee is the embodiment of Lynch's trademark weirdness as she experiences the psychic trauma of a teenage incest victim. The enabling mother, clueless friends, self-destructive behavior, and dark secrets are all played out in the idyllic nightmare of Twin Peaks. The graphic tone of Fire Walk With Me allows Lee to better carry out Lynch's vision of what lurked beneath the quirky television series.
A masterpiece simple
I am not a big fan of the tv series, twin peaks and now that it has been turned into a tv movie, it's even more worse, I also watch the new twin peaks sequel tv show, it's ok so far andi wanted to watch everything twin peaks and now I have. This movie and franchise of twin peaks is pretty forgettable but at least it has my favorite actor kyle whatever his last name is, he should've been in this movie more, aka ever scene .
MASTERPIECE Bob is scary
I typed out my review of this last night after watching it and Flixster bit it hard, cause why should Facebook maintain their other apps? this movie was not good. This movie was bad, and I don't know why they bothered to make it. It added nothing that we didn't already know, apart from Blue Rose which had no additional information and alien rune ring which, okay, who cares? The lack of Blue Rose information seems to indicate they hoped to make more movies (and presumably not that they were like "hey, if we're mostly all alive in 2017 let's make a really slow paced show about Dougie Jones standing around not doing stuff) but they did a BAD job with this movie, where somehow the acting managed to get worse than the show the same damn people were just on the two years prior, and seemed to exist to just be all "here's two hours of breasts, loud music, and some incest. Just in case you were upset we didn't actually show it to you on primetime network television." And all the problems that this movie has with pacing are the same problems they're making again in the non-adventures of Dougie Jones.
As with most David Lynch material, this movie is hard to critique.

In a way, this is one of my favorite Lynch films to date. It's also one of the most horrifying.
Fire Walk with Me attempts to ditch it's trademark campy soap tone and tell the story of what happened to Laura Palmer before her death in a dark mature nature. Instead, Sheryl Lee's performance can't save Fire Walk with Me from it's nonsensical boredom that disservices fans.
If you're watching Season you should re-watch this
Highly enjoyable, but extremely dark. This film isn't for everybody.
A bit too bizarre for me; the awesome weirdness of the series doesn't play out as well in a movie's length. Need to rewatch!
Accepting Wild at Heart as a flame-fueled story in a Lynchian technique helps to not only concur with the film's harshest critics, but also celebrate the very qualities they condemn.
I have a hard time focusing during Lynch's films, but so many of Wild at Heart's extreme scenes stick with me.
I enjoyed it more back in 1990, though I'd be hard-pressed to recall exactly why -- viewing it now, it's only a marginally satisfying experience, with some potent set-pieces diluted by an almost juvenile predilection on Lynch's part.
There is no denying the fun to be had with Wild at Heart. Its irresistibly charismatic leads draw you into Lynch's anything goes, 50s-inflected nightmare with an ease and insanity that's unlike anything put to film before or after.
I don't think at all that 'Wild Heart' is one of the great works of David Lynch, but I must say it is a wildly entertaining road movie about love, passion and freedom. [Full review in Spanish]
Most of the time it's unquestionably disturbing, but every so often a hint of deeper meaning pokes through the strangeness.
A non-stop fun-fest that doesn't have tried to be groovy, but goes to great pains to make sure things stay that way.
Perhaps the major problem is that despite Cage and Dern's best efforts, Lynch is ultimately interested only in iconography, not characters at all.
The scattergun nastiness is, after a while, profoundly unaffecting.
Lynch brings forth a world where evil and weirdness coexist, the two being these obstacles that arise in the way of a romance unlike any other.
There's a spontaneous, anything-can-happen feeling to it that's the primary appeal of any road movie.
A perverse, violent, nutso depiction of romance that even Bonnie and Clyde would shrug off as too hardcore for them.
Should be perceived as a wicked comedy.
The result's mostly empty at heart and hollow on top.
Even the title is a letdown, somehow.
Joltingly violent, wickedly funny and rivetingly erotic.
It's not a pleasant film by any definition, and it's not remotely for everyone, but it's true to Lynch's vision.
Lynch's paean to Wizard of Oz divided critics when it premeiered at Cannes, and it never found an audience beyond the helmer's fans who enjoyed the fable's couple (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) taking their own Yellow Brick Road in search of the wizard
David Lynch walked Willem Dafoe on down to the wardrobe department, and just told them: "Make this man look like a gross John Waters". 
Wild at Heart is very 'David Lynch' - wandering and immersed in puzzling tone/character design, but strange to the point of endearment. As a filmmaker, it seems that Lynch has a particular talent for creating a range of distinctive, memorable, and unique characters, but also revels in dense ambiguity when it comes to theme and plot; this combination gives him the appearance of an appealing and interesting artist, but it's a bit of a cop-out, leaving your films so wide open to interpretation that they are essentially meaningless. In certain contexts, like the mental instability of Mulholland Dr., this structure makes sense and plays well into the design of the film. But in Wild at Heart, there is just as much confusion as there is entertainment value for what is essentially a traditional road movie at its core. It's not like every film needs to be completely objective and literal, but Wild at Heart is a good representation of Lynch's tendency to drop bizarre breadcrumbs which people eat up and furiously defend as divinely inspired.
For the many, many scenarios where it will be relevant in the future: Eisenhower Dollars are not silver dollars. They look like them, but have no silver content. This has been 'Pedantic Coin-Based Movie Trivia'. (3/5)
This movie is honestly crazy. This is the type of movie you show to someone who has never seen a movie, so they never want to watch another. I'm not sure how many Wizard of Oz references were made, but all I'll say is.. to many. Willem Dafoe as Bobby Peru was pure gold. Some of his scenes will haunt me for life. I think I've changed as a person after seeing this. I'm inspired.
Wild at Heart is not David Lynch at his best, personally much prefer Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story and is definitely not going to be everybody's cup of tea. But while it has its flaws Wild at Heart still impresses and fascinates in many ways, also don't think that it's his worst like some people I know in the past have said(that'd be Dune). The story does feel very randomly structured at times, especially true with Crispin Glover, and some of the pacing slackens; the film could have done with being shorter as some scenes did feel too padded and underdeveloped, and the script can be a confused jumble and not always easy to understand completely(though admittedly there are some quotable lines). There are many great things with Wild at Heart however because the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is bursting with vivid colour and there are plenty of bold colours and lighting with some of the visuals being wonderfully deranged. There is also a hypnotic soundtrack that adds so much to the feel of the film, the music choices being also quite interesting, while Lynch's direction while not the best he's ever done(tied between Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive) but it is very adept and has his unique style all over. The story is not the best but the atmosphere is just great, just loved the campiness, the eroticism and haunting weirdness, it's hardly uneventful and there are some memorable moments like the incredibly chilling robbery sequence and the ending. The Wizard of Oz references while a little over-used are fun. The characters are not likable at all, in fact in the cases of Marietta and Bobby a few of them could be seen as loathsome, but considering the atmosphere and viciously violent but also sexy content of the film it is clear that they weren't intended to be. The performances are fine, Nicholas Cage will induce polarising opinions but while he was wooden to start with he was charming and entertaining once he warmed up. Laura Dern is alluring with the two working comfortably together, while Diana Ladd manages to be both hilarious and scary and Willem Dafoe is unforgettably creepy. The cameos acquit themselves well too. All in all, incredibly strange and not without flaws but also fascinating. 7/10 Bethany Cox
I guess this is generally seen as one of Lynch's lesser works but personally found this to be a thoroughly brilliant piece of work. Made around the same time as the first 2 series of Twin Peaks, it has the same combination of comic weirdness, soap opera melodrama, and terrifying violence but less of the "haunting" feeling of latter-day Lynch. Reads to me as a chronicle of the sordidness and emptiness at the heart of America, whilst still being very much of that country in terms of aesthetics and style. The only thing which I disliked was the film's sexual politics, the repeated sex scenes with Laura Dern felt somewhat unnecessary; the unpleasant scene with Dern and Willem Dafoe also felt off in the context of a film with so much of the male gaze.
Come on, it's easy to dismiss this movie as trashy, but follow Lynch along in his extravaganza and you'll have a good time. Visually speaking it's very stimulating, swinging from crazy violence to turbid eroticism. The soundtrack is marvelous too, and is deeply influenced by one of the two drivers of the movie, which is Elvis. The other driver is Oz, interpreted in an original way.
This movie was shot during the Twin Peaks days, and it is clear because of the actors (brace yourselves 'till the end for crazy cameos) and the mood...at times it feels like Twin Peaks in the South.
one huge cliche of a film featuring a guy with terrible tooth decay. what even was this film... pilot is a character who just "has it all", he has this good guy image with an extremely opposite other side, the first few seconds of the film was very unexpected which i very much enjoyed, but the further the film went on the more ridiculous it got... the terribly edited harpy wailing in the bar when he sings... the unecessary car crash scene which had nothing to do with anything, it kind of just "happened"... let's not forget the part where he just decides to walk away from his lover and kid THE DAY HE MET HIM, then gets randomly punched for no reason at all by some gang who just stare at him while he's passed out, has a vision of some fairy in a wallmart costume, wakes up and appologises to the thugs for calling them a bunch of f@gs and then terribly sings love me tender to his girl while standing on top of a car after just leaving her a few minutes earlier...
this movie was made for mentally disfunctional boomers, a true late 80s to early 90s absolute crapfest. also what was with the mum? what an egghead. it's worth a watch once because it's simply so bad and a good laugh, make sure you drink though, no one can watch this sober,crazy this got 81% audience score, people must be drinking windex
I love this movie, though maybe not quite as much as a number of Lynch's other films. What's different about this one is that it's really a black comedy road movie. That's not to say it's without serious moments. It's one of Lynch's most violent movies and there are a couple of scenes here which are genuinely disturbing. Overall though, it shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's incredibly entertaining. Like Blue Velvet, it's very strange with much imagery typical of Lynch but has a plot that is easy to follow. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are fantastic, but the best performance would have to be from Willem Dafoe, unforgettable as Bobby Peru, one of the most underrated movie villains ever.
Eat you heart out, 'True Romance'.
The idea of Cage and Lynch working together seems pretty natural when I think about it and I am not sure what has taken me so long to indulge, the results of which begin to pay off about thirty seconds into this hilariously macabre story.
Dern and Cage lead what is an amazing ensemble cast highlighted for me in the performances of Harry Dean Stanton and Willem Dafoe. 7.5/10
Compared to what I've come to expect from Lynch, it's pretty garbage. Cage, Dern, and DaFoe are great but the excessive side characters and lack of a cohesive plot really drags this one down for me. The pieces are there and there were a few really fun moments but it never came together
One twisted perverted nightmare . What else can you expect from lynch . I try to never watch trailers or read the synopsis. This is an example of that . The synopsis gives away something that legitimately happens 2/3 of the way thru the movie . I kept anticipating for it for over an hour 2.9 I’m sure this is artsy and allegorical as well which I also missed behind all the nudity and perversion
High-strung rebounds and metallic-wailing maxims, Sailor and Lula take you on a ride well worth the offending watch. Know the air in the first 5-minutes, stab it and steer!
Red pillness, drama, an alpha chad and a young hypergamic girl, perfect couple in an unfree world. One of David lynch best releases.
Lynch's pleasing aesthetic fueled with sophisticated irony makes this drama a must watch.
David Lynch adapts the book by Barry Gifford Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern are star crossed lovers; Sailor Ripley and Lula are nothing without each other but her mother, Marietta has strong reservations about Ripley one night someone pulls a knife on him and he kills him in self-defense, that's all it takes for her to put all her power into keeping them apart after Ripley serves time in prison he and Lula decide to make a run for it but her mother hires a hit man the other players include Grace Zabriskie, Crispin Glover, Willem Dafoe, Harry Dean Stanton and Cheryl Lee Dafoe is Peru, an old buddy of Sailor's that means more trouble than it's worth it proves to be hard for these two lovers to stay together amidst everything stacked against them David Lynch has been known to make such surreal films but with this one he's sorta restrained himself, of course he's got many of his signature elements most notably there's a lot of odd odes to the Wizard of Oz here but told in a modern way, even the editing gets downright bizarre randomly going back and forth between the past and present with plenty of weirdness and depravity among the sexual content and violence When it was released the cultural tides had already shifted and the inevitable backlash against Lynch had already begun Although modestly successful at the box office, it was blasted by many critics who found it to be a lazy and ultimately work that bordered on self-parody So maybe Lynch got a bit lost of focus with this particular vision and this certainly won't be for everyone's taste There's better films of this director's caliber that stays on track But it's nice to see Cage and Dern act as brave souls who try to overcome all the evils out there, after all they are ‘wild at heart' being madly in love
Its narrative and tone are quite uneven, but it's still an interesting and entertaining addition to David Lynch's distinguished filmography, with some bloody and engaging action scenes, a surreal and haunting atmosphere, dark humor, interesting Wizard of Oz references, and compelling lead performances from Nicolas Cage and Laura Deen.
Too odd for me, it didn't work one bit.
I definitely prefer Blue Velvet. Wild At Heart suffers from some pacing issues that cause the film to drag in places. I was wondering why the Santos and Marietta characters were off screen for such a large chunk of time in the final act. The nightmarish and surreal aspects of the film were hit or miss; more miss than hit in my opinion. Cage and Dern have believable chemistry and pretty much carry the movie, however as characters I didn't care much about their journey. This came off as more style than substance in my opinion. I enjoyed Lynch's trademark humor and bizarre characters but as a whole this just didn't really do it for me. The unique 'Love Me Tender' finale was a nice touch at least.
Cage and Dern did the best they could, considering the uneven screenplay
Nicolas Cage was born to be in a David Lynch film
literally what the fuck is going on
One of the best films ever made
If Blue Velvet worked for you, this probably will too. Unfortunately, this does the very opposite of "work for" me. Vigorously, painfully so. All the posing and fake screams and cooky looks and sexy Dern outfits, but so precious goddamn little of any actual substance. Whatever changed in Lynch's life to bring about Mulholland Drive - it must've been huge.
Erotic entertainment although a slow burn. David Lynch's Wild at Heart is an insane road trip with surreal editing and strange occurrences galore. Unfortunately, Wild at Heart is so weird, it often delves too deep into oddity just for the sake of having quirky characters. It's a slow burn that is like a colorful noir, but can reach too far into the melodramatic, instead of the more serious drama it's striving for at times. The humor is unexpected and really catches you off guard, while the gripping serious drama moments can snap instantly into frightening. Lynch freely uses nudity and eroticism to tantalize viewers, which can be seductive and interesting, but constantly pushes your patience with seemingly random naked girls perhaps just to peak your interest. I just do not feel that the excessive nudity in Wild at Heart feels necessary or that it adds to the plot. Only Laura Dern's brave volume of nude scenes strike a chord and captivate with any deeper meaning. Lynch's direction is stunning and often intriguing. His sheer creative perspective choices are fascinating, even when Wild at Heart doesn't always work. The sleazy eroticism meet the surreal romance and quirky spasms of random entertainment all culminate for a genuinely wild experience watching Wild at Heart. The music ranges from exciting heavy metal passages to sweet romantic classical scoring. The metallic moments are unexpected, yet delightful, while Angelo Badalamenti's romantic score is so sweet that it wins you over. I actually like the sudden jolts of electric sound for shocking reveals edited into the film at decisive instances. Wild at Heart makes innovative use of its sound choices. The acting is Wild at Heart is intriguing all on its own. Laura Dern is phenomenal as the Southern belle Lula Pace Fortune with her sexual desire and alluringly sweet presence. She is charming and likable, while you feel a strong sympathy for her character Lula. Dern depicts trauma, love, and survival quite maturely for her age. Nicolas Cage is trying his best, while still melodramatic, he is likable. His Elvis impersonation is actually pretty convincing as the hard edged Sailor Ripley. He is a cool lead and an entertaining performer. I absolutely adored Harry Dean Stanton as Johnnie Farragut. He is quite endearing despite his shorter supporting role. You really feel bad for him immediately due to Stanton's sweet and docile performance. On the other hand, Willem Dafoe is unforgettable as the sleazy and crazy Bobby Peru. His wild persona and crazy eyes are fun to watch as Dafoe uses unsettling body language and sudden jumps of dialogue to engage you in terror at all times while his presence perverts the screen. I must mention Diane Ladd as Marietta Fortune. Her overbearing and wild antics grace the screen with a truly unhinged performance. She is unnerving every second she is shoved in front of you. I must admit that I did not care for one of the main supporting actors, namely, J. E. Freeman as Marcello Santos. He is creepy, but not as ghastly as Dafoe. He is unhinged, but not as mad as Ladd. He is a weaker villain that basically goes away suddenly with no arc or resolution, honestly. I also have to complain that despite their memorable roles and limited screen time, Crispin Glover and Isabella Rossellini gave riveting performances. Glover is so odd and eerie in Dern's story about Dell that I must commend Glover's skillful acting. Rossellini is gorgeous and sexy in her brief cameo as Perdita Durango, as she seduces you with her every word and glance. I just wish she had a bigger role in Wild at Heart. Overall, Wild at Heart is safely in the middle of David Lynch's filmography. It's not a great film by any means, but it had the potential to be one. Laura Dern and Nicolas Cage can be proud of possibly their career best performances. Likewise, Willem Dafoe and Harry Dean Stanton again prove their respective prowess as phenomenal character actors. In short, Wild at Heart is certainly entertaining, but not wild enough to make up for the slow pace and longer run time.
A wonderfully grotesque pantomime of violence and sex studded with some great dialogue, scuzzball locations and a rocking soundtrack. What's not to like
I watched all of it hoping it would get better but it never really did. No wonder its never on tv. One of those movies thats on really late at night cause its too rude. So many boob scenes
I liked very much Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, but disliked Lost Highway and Inland Empire. Wild at Heart sits somewhere in the middle. Nicolas Cage/ Laura Dern memorable couple s. although they didnt really do that much other than fornicate and drive and encounter strange characters.
There's just too many dissatisfying elements to this movie that are incredibly risky with no real pay off. The best I can say of it is that I have never seen anything like it, even in Lynch's canon. Overall this feels like an exercise in just how over-the-top you can do a love story as an absurdist comedy.. which can only satisfy so much.
Like most Lynch, it's nightmarish, funny, and bizarre as hell. It's a haunting love story on the road, where the protagonists are being hunted, unbeknownst to them. With hints of Wizard of Oz they meet some crazy and colorful characters along the way. Whether you like this movie or not, it's going to stick with you.
Excellent crime drama. The love story is a little corny but the narrative makes it enjoyable. The only thing I don't like is that Lula is too weak. There are no abundant hallucinations or delusions yet, which is trademark of Lynch's later works.
A very ambitious road movie with some gruesome details but otherwise leaning on the charming performances of the two leads in love and feeling free
this is a mixed one strange highs and strange lows
What did I just watch and how has this movie such a high rating? Definitely up there with the dumbest movies I've ever watched!
Typical Lynch but sometimes feels weird just for the sake of it.
Wizard of Oz on crack with Nic Cage impersonating Elvis Presley with murderous impulses? I mean, c'mon... just take my money.
The greatest moments are those where Lynch shows no fear of cliches or self-parody; they save the film from the few dreadful scenes that follow the spectacular opening which will make you want to turn the film off immediately. However, sitting through these moments will prove rewarding with a much better second half and an ending that's everything you could hope for and more.
Wild at Heart is a movie about love-struck youngsters making poor decisions and chain smoking while the evil mother-in-law's murder posse is hot on their trail as told through some kind of Wizard of Oz motif. I loved it. This is Nicolas Cage at his best, long before getting mixed up in bullshit like Gone in 60 Seconds & The Wicker Man. As with every David Lynch film, oddly menacing characters and moments of dark absurdity will either repel or overjoy the viewer. There's just no way to accurately describe a David Lynch experience. If there's one director whose technique is truly inimitable, it is totally David Lynch. Willem Dafoe as creepy asshole Bobby Peru is one of my favorite characters of all time.
David Lynch cranks out gruelling sex and uber-violence and disconnected Wizard of Oz references in an overblown yet somehow languorous (and too long) version of the titular book (which I haven't read). Sailor (Nic Cage) and Lula (Laura Dern) are young lovers on the run from her mother (Diane Ladd; yes, really her mother) and the strange thugs she hires to kill him (Harry Dean Stanton, Willem Dafoe included). Not much makes sense (as usual) but something is missing here from the Lynch films that "work" - perhaps his feel for the mysterious has been sacrificed for a hysterical metallic sheen? There are some arresting images (including some that you can't "unsee"), fleeting cameos, and puzzling inserts but it doesn't carry you along as Lost Highway does (despite its own failures) and it doesn't resonate with unearthed themes as Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive do. Cage and Dern got a raw deal, despite their willingness to go all the way. This reminds me why it took me a long time to warm up to Lynch. Give it a miss.
Tremendously cool and gritty, strangely romantic.
Down the Postmodern Yellow Brick Road "Wild at Heart" is not one of the most famous films by David Lynch, but I think it is as worthy as his best ones. Perhaps its unique genre has been preventing a wider appreciation of the movie. The plot is deliberately simple. There are two sweethearts, Lula Fortune and Sailor Ripley. Sailor goes to prison for killing a gangster who tried to kill him. Lula's mother hates Sailor and wants her daughter to break up with him, but Lula waits for him. As soon as Sailor gets out of prison, he breaks parole and takes his love on a road-trip adventure. Wild at Heart has multiple allusions to the Wizard of Oz, with the wicked witch (Lula's mother) and the adventure and troubles of a little girl (Lula). Some of these references are even direct, like in the scene where Lula is clicking her ruby slippers. Of course, in modern times you don't walk down the yellow brick road - you drive. The lovers encounter numerous dangers on their way. PULP FICTION: Wild at Heart looks to me like a precursor to Pulp Fiction which was made by Quentin Tarantino four years later. Both movies are loaded with pop-culture references, which are a favorite fodder of postmodern directors (Wizard of Oz, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, gangster novels). Both have a simple comic book-like plot. Even the names Sailor Ripley and Lula Fortune sound like they came from a comic book or a paperback novel. However, this simplicity is intentional - in the postmodern art the plot is usually no more than a loose guidance, a necessity used by the director to express his art. It's the same idea as when a jazz band takes a simple tune and transforms it into a completely new and fascinating art piece. There are many other similarities between the two movies. For example, the mobster's name Marcelo Santos resonates with Pulp Fiction's gangster Marcellus Wallace. Uma Thurman identifies Travolta as an Elvis man as opposed to a Beatles man - well, Lynch clearly casts Sailor as an Elvis man in his movie. But the main similarity between Wild at Heart and Pulp Fiction is the fact that in both cases we are watching an absolutely low-brow material - which normally we would skip - but are enjoying it as true art. We genuinely yearn to be around the characters, in the midst of an action, forgetting the fact that this marvelous artwork is actually built out of pulp. Tarantino will develop the same method even further with Kill Bill, but for David Lynch this is the only movie of such kind. One difference of the way Pulp Fiction is made is that the episodes in it are not sequential, even though you can mentally restore the timeline. Lynch will use the same approach later in Mulholland Drive, which is even harder to reconstruct than Pulp Fiction (although possible). The point is to take the viewer's attention away from the linear plot, from the comfort of knowing what's next, and instead focus on each episode or character alone. LYNCH'S AESTHETICS: There is a plethora of weird episodic characters in the movie, which is typical for Lynch. He always handpicks collections of bizarre and freaky creatures in his films, which are often unnecessary for the plot but create an intense mood. The pigeon-squawking man, the maniacal woman with orthopedic leg, the three fat "porn models", Mr. Reindeer (another typical comic book-like character) - the list can go on and on. This alluring ensemble of freaks and weirdos circles around our lovers on the yellow brick road. Some of them are just confusing, while others are menacing. Very few are amicable, like the old black gas station attendant who is tapping joyfully to Lula's dancing, his legs sticking out of short work overalls trousers as thin as the legs of the chair he is sitting on. ROAD HAZARDS: It feels like Lula and Sailor are the only sane people, devoid of evil tendencies, surrounded by hostile and mad reality - or perhaps they have accidentally landed in a scary fairy tale. Their journey to happiness hits snag after snag along the yellow brick road. The radio in the car keeps talking about horrible crimes and accidents on every frequency, and the atmosphere of distress is trying to put them down. They stop the car, jump out and start kissing. This may be their only way to escape, even if futile. Our heroes are alone in their adventure, and all they can hold onto is their love and the foolish snakeskin jacket, proclaimed to be a "symbol of individuality and personal freedom". But the clouds are darkening over them. The ending is a bit trivial - the Good Witch descends upon Sailor and makes all the troubles go away. The happy end contradicts the overall ominous trend of the movie. However, if we subscribe to the genre of a fairy tale, then isn't it supposed to end well? ACTING: I must admit I've never been a fan of Nicholas Cage, especially when he plays a smart or compassionate person. But he really excels as a simple-minded straight-talking wild-at-heart character like Sailor. It often takes a great director to make actors achieve their best. Willem Dafoe puts up an excellent performance as a remarkably despicable mobster Bobby Peru. He is repellent and attractive at the same time, and even Lula almost surrenders to him (remember her bent outward fingers - her "tell"?). Lula's mother displays a harmonious combination of murderous and humane sides, lying and trusting at the same time. Painting the face red before betraying and dooming her former lover is a fascinating scene reminiscent of the ancient theatre. She is evil and vengeful, yet so feminine and vulnerable. GENRE: So is Wild at Heart a road-trip movie? A love story? A fairy tale? A gangster movie? Neither, even though it freely plays with the elements of all these genres. In order to understand it, one should drop the perception constraints of any specific genre and start enjoying the movie as a unique creation. Then the movie will open up, scene by scene, like a good wine which reveals the depth of taste as you sip it. And even if characters or events follow a familiar pattern, don't get bound by it: the postmodern paradigm does not expect the viewers to take anything they see at face value. A good example of this is the ending of Fellini's film "And the Ship Sails On" where the camera shows - as if by accident - that the ship on which the action has been taking place is just a prop in the studio. (I have actually met somebody once who complained that the movie is cheaply made because of that scene...) Overall, Wild at Heart is a remarkable postmodern feature, unique in its kind for Lynch yet in the same league as Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead.
Weird movie, although not completely in a bad way, with a really sweet ending. Great work from David Lynch
Wild at Heart is literally the combination of Cage-flicks and David Lynch movies. So if you're into that, this is a movie for you. Weird and full of meaning, but with a coherent story line, I can say this is an enjoyable movie. Scenes like the old man with squirrel voice that had nothing to do with anything, that I don't know if I can forgive, though.
I was warned, and yet I did not anticipate just how insane this film was. Lynch, Cage, and nearly ever single side character are completely out of control. The sound design and editing allude to a larger world inside the individual character's heads. The character of Laura Dern shows there is a complexity informed by trauma that her outward performance does best to hide. An extremely dark comedy. It has horror, romance, and avant guard experimentalism that feels similar in tone, yet different in flavor, to Lynch's other surreal work.
One of David Lynch's mainstream crime dramas that I never had an interest in seeing back when I was younger. I'm a fan of many of his other movies, but this one didn't do anything for me. The beginning of the film gives the false impression of it being a stylish masterpiece, but then the story takes a nosedive into short interesting scenarios that tend to go nowhere. For the most part, everything becomes too silly with singing and unnecessary parody performances. To make matters even worse, it all leads up to something very anticlimactic. Nicholas Cage once again at the height of his career, recognized for portraying an impractical character.
Despite multiple scenes of exploitation, it's hard to deny this electrifying and peculiar combo of comedy, drama, crime, and romance.
Funny, disturbing, and indeed wild at heart. One of Nic Cage's better movies as well as a little homage to the wizard of oz and Bonnie and Clyde. If you like true romance or natural born killers with some David lynch isms, worth a watch
Loved the Elvis theme and Cage's singing. Too surreal for me though, i mean wtf did i watch
A spiral descent towards the hell, disguised as a pseudo-religious mirage, that we call Hollywood. [Full review in Spanish]
A film just as much about Hollywood as it is about the viewer trusting their skills as a motion picture dream detective, Mulholland Dr. is a rare kind of masterpiece.
a black mirror in which the audience see whatever they want; a noir thriller, a history of Hollywood, a LGBT drama...
David Lynch's gloriously specific and frustrating masterpiece still stands as an unparalleled, idiosyncratic work of cinema.
A hypnotic masterpiece.
A beautiful, gripping fever dream. Loaded with haunting imagery and a star making performance by Naomi Watts, this is Lynch at his most accessible...without compromising any of his artistic vision.
It seems that the 21st century began with Mulholland Drive. [Full review in Spanish]
Delving into Mulholland Drive can be like falling into a rabbit hole. Yet it's a journey that has kept me fascinated, perplexed, and enthralled with every visit.
With Mulholland Drive, the trance that comes so easily to him is finally charged with the doom of a classic.
If, in the end, Mulholland Drive is too clever by half, no matter. Lynch's superb command of mise en scène makes his images and situations their own reward, rendering even the simplest gesture creepy and imbuing any innocence with evil.
David Lynch's genuinely scary Hollywood horror film...
This is David Lynch's Persona, a pyscho-sexual exploration of memory and identity that is clearly the work of an artist working at the height of his creative powers.
An allegory about the dark corners of Hollywood, what it does to the psyche of those in pursuit of the classic American success story trying to make it big in the pictures.
Lynch understands better than anyone how pop culture items such as old rock tunes and movie musicals are ingrained in everyone's (sub)consciousness, quietly defining people's aspirations and perception.
Though Mulholland Drive does not employ reverse chronology as such, it is about a fundamental disconnect - as David Roche called it - between narration and diegesis.
Mulholland Drive is maddeningly abstract and inscrutable on first viewing, but hypnotic and haunting on every viewing after.
Taking an open ended TV pilot rejected by the networks, [Lynch] added 45 minutes and created closure in a weird, mystical logic that, in its unique Lynchian way, makes a twisted emotional sense.
Knowingly exploiting the tropes and clichés of Hollywood film while eschewing its formal and logical boundaries, Lynch's film strikes at the heart of cinema's power to represent mood, sensation and altered states of perception.
Mulholland Dr is reissued some 15 years after it was released. It was rapidly hailed as the first great US film of the century. None since has been any more powerful.
Luxuriously strange.
Blue Velvet is quite possibly David's Lynch's most accessible film, and is certainly a contender for his greatest, rivaled only by Mulholland Drive. Unlike Mulholland Drive though, the film unfolds in a coherent linear timeline while still containing flashes of Lynch's trademark surrealism.
Blue Velvet opens with brilliant use the eponymous song accompanying cheerful images reminiscent of 1950's and early 60's American culture, seemingly constructed to make the audience long for Mom's homemade apple pie. The featured town of Lumberton is displayed with sunny disposition that quickly gives way to squirming insects buried under the surface of the freshly mowed lawns. This motif whereby the seedy underbelly of carefree small town USA is exposed has been used since and to great effect in Lynch's equally magnificent television show Twin Peaks. Insects are continuously referenced throughout Blue Velvet to remind the viewer of the hidden darkness just beneath the surface of any(every)town, USA.
Dennis Hopper's Golden Globe nominated (and undeniably Oscar-worthy) role as Frank Booth has been rightfully hailed as one of the greatest villainous characters in cinema history. Some reviewers are overly critical of operatic, "scenery chewing" performances. In contrast, I find over the top performances to be extremely gratifying and believe they possess great artistic merit. Hopper's performance is reminiscent to Gary Oldman's sadistic and psychotic detective in Leon: The Professional or Al Pacino's boisterous and ballsy gangster Tony Montana in Scarface. Frank Booth is sociopathic and hedonistic crime boss who is somehow miraculously able to inspire both moments of laughter and goosebumps in equal measure. His aggressive and profanity laden banter ("Let's fuck! I'll fuck anything that moves"!) is highly comical and imminently quotable, but the laughs quickly give way to moments of unbearable suspense and discomfort whenever his extremely short fuse runs out. Scenes that display Booth's gas huffing, his penchant for incestuous rape fetishes, and his "love letter" speech powerfully exhibit that reality.
It is suggested that Frank Booth's hyper-masculinity and chest-thumping bravado serve to mask his more private desires. A scene where Frank begins crying while observing his cross-dressing criminal associate Ben (a wonderful supporting turn by Dean Stockwell) lip synch Roy Orbison's In Dreams along with Booth's fascination with the young male protagonist (a great leading role by the charismatic Kyle McLachlan) allude to possible repressed bisexual or homosexual urges. This possibility is made more evident when such moments of sentimentality are quickly buried in a sea of rage. These traits only elevate Hopper's already show stopping performance from just a great portrayal of a villain to a legendary portrayal of a grandiose and towing monster possessing unusual emotional depth, but said depth makes him no less evil.
Lynch's masterwork is painted with typical dark shades of neo-noir (even throwing in the classic femme fatale trope to boot), which are now hallmarks of his iconic style. During more surrealist moments, shadows give way to blurred images, animalistic noises, and stop-frame cinematography sporadically. These too, are defining Lynchian traits which are populated throughout his work, but are used more sparsely here. These brilliant directorial elements along with a terrific cast and a superb script full of wistful and contemplative musings on dreams by the hero and heroine (the charming juxtaposed against Frank's Booth's rabid outbursts and hauntingly cruel proclamations catapult Blue Velvet far above nearly any other mystery thriller that comes to mind.
Lynch's direction was notably and justifiably nominated for Best Director at the 59th Academy Awards. Contending against Oliver Stone's taut direction of his Vietnam War masterpiece, Platoon, Lynch was just a bit too subversive to bring home the gold. Despite my love for Platoon as a film along with its superb cast, few directors, if any, are able to create films that match the pure romantic and vague nostalgic dreamscapes of Lynch's best work.
Ultimately, Blue Velvet's legacy has grown far beyond cult classic status. Lynch has unsurprisingly accumulated a lovingly devoted following, myself included, who tend to spend far too much time trying to decipher his more cryptic work. Blue Velvet is likely the definitive Lynch film as well as the greatest example of surrealism in cinema (I'd put it a good step above Fellini's 8 1/2), because it hits every single mark without coming close to missing. Even objectively, there is nothing negative I can say about this film and I believe it is highly deserving of every accolade thrown its way, even to the point where I would describe Blue Velvet as underrated. It is simply a perfect film by one of cinema's all time greatest auteurs.
Dennis Hopper commands every second of your attention.  The movie is the best of David Lynch's weirdness, and it's great fun!
Lynch is such a hack. Soap opera man living in a diner. So tragic.
And now a classic. Lynch tends to pass over the heads of many an average moviegoer as well as educated cinephiles. What else can you say besides some will love it & some will hate it. Lynch is the one filmmaker who is consistent at the uncomfortable.
I'm not much of a David Lynch fan. Dennis Hopper is brilliant in this. Frank Booth - his character - is a wonderful character study and it seems his creation. And that is the problem. Had the writer / director created it as it is, it would have been more integrated into the fabric of the movie
It's a great movie, with great photography and visual effects for its time. The story is revealed early on, but the suspense is kept all the way till the very end. A story of many people, and none of those their stories is truly revealed or reaches clarity. A movie worth being watched more than once, with scenes that will surely stay with us for a long time
In a montage at the beginning of Blue Velvet, a man tending to his beautifully manicured lawn falls to the ground, clearly in distress.  The camera slowly snakes its way into the thick grass, revealing a mass of beetles fighting for survival is the soil.  In what is probably his most Lynch-like film, David Lynch exposes the ugliness and brutality that often exists buried behind a beautiful façade.  Centering around a college student and his investigation into a human ear he found in a park, Blue Velvet is everything that you'd expect from a Lynch film – visually stunning and imaginative images, fascinating characters, outlandish scenarios, dialogue that always feels a bit off-center, and an eerie score and soundtrack that sets the mood.  As ugly and violent as it sometimes is, it is compelling viewing and impossible to turn away from.
Not, of course, for everyone. But it gets better and better with time. A movie that caused a little uproar on release, and would never get studio funding now. Intense.
David Lynch is a very love-him-hate-him director, with people fascinated by his style and imagery and others who find his films not easy to follow and too weird for their tastes. As somebody who loves Lynch and a lot of his films(the only one I've disliked is Dune), Blue Velvet is up there at the top. The Elephant Man(never has there been a film that moved me more) may be my personal favourite but Blue Velvet is quite possibly Lynch's masterpiece. Loved Mulholland Drive as well, but it is not as accessible as Elephant Man or Blue Velvet- films that even those who aren't fans of Lynch are likely to love- and is his most polarising most likely.
Blue Velvet is an incredible-looking film. All of Lynch's films are beautifully shot and that is true of Blue Velvet as well, and the imagery is both hauntingly surreal and beautiful, all the different colours really popping out at you. The music is hypnotic with a very haunting undercurrent and really adds to the story's strangeness and mystery elements. The script is thoughtful and cohesive with a dose of weird but subtle humour as well as some deliberately not so subtle parts(especially with villain Frank Booth). The atmosphere created is the very meaning of scintillating and suspense levels are to the maximum. The story- one of the most coherent and accessible of any Lynch film- is always interesting and entertaining, the detective story elements are genuinely suspenseful and at times scary, Lynch has never directed a tenser scene than the climax here.
Lynch's direction is superb; along with Mulholland Drive it contains some of his best. The characters all serve a point to the story and they are very interestingly written, in the case of Frank Booth, one of the most evil and fascinating villains on films, iconic. The acting is superb as well, especially with Dennis Hopper who's terrifyingly sadistic and sometimes hilarious, he is very over the top but in a gleefully enjoyable way. Kyle MacLachlan has never been in a better film or given a better performance than here, he's certainly not had a character as interesting either, Laura Dern is great and sensual Isabella Rossellini has a challenging role that she plays to truly devastating effect. Look out for an oddball but memorable appearance from Dean Stockwell as well. Overall, a strange but utterly mesmerising masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox
Strange but excellent flix.  What else could you expect from Lynch?  Great crime drama in a deranged way.
A very strange movie but incredible. A young man (Kyle MacLaclan) comes home to help care for his sick father. Soon he's in love with a detective's daughter (Laura Dern) and mixed up in a mystery involving Dorothy Valdes (Isabella Rossellinni) and psycho Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).Probably David Lynch's best film. The story has gaps in logic, but it's secondary to some incredible wide screen imagery (this has to be seen letter-boxed...no two ways about it). Lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie. You can tell...things that make no sense at first gradually make sense later on. This movie also demands multiple viewings...I was so shocked the first time I saw it, I couldn't concentrate on it...it took THREE viewings to finally get it. As to what the movie is about...it depends who you ask. Some people said it's the Hardy Boys on drugs...others say it's about a boy's sexual awakening...others see it as good vs. evil...each one is a valid statement! To me, that's a true art film...one that means multiple things all at once.The performances are top-notch. This film made MacLachlan...him and Laura Dern work well together and give nice low-key performances. Dern is just great...but she does look pretty silly when she tries to cry. Rossellinni is nowhere near as good as her mother (Ingrid Bergman) was, but she deserves credit for taking such a risky role. She's pretty good. Hopper is WAYYYYYYY over the top as Booth...he's both horrifying and hilarious...a great performance. And let's not forget Dean Stockwell as "suave Ben". His "performance" of "In Dreams" is a definite highlight.Be warned--the film is very extreme. There's explicit violence, plenty of nudity, sex and tons of profanity. Not for the squeamish. Still, I loved it from beginning to end. One of my favorite films of all time.
This has always been a unique crime movie, like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways, it's a sick film...but utterly fascinating, even after a handful of viewings. It's a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters.This movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen: "Frank Booth," played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here, "Dorothy Vallens," played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.Kyle MacLaclan is good as the nosy late-teen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothy's apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.In a movie that features strange characters, the strangest scene of them - and there are a number - is in Booth's apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwell's lip-synching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake, though: as bizarre as this film can get, it's mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get very uncomfortable to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. He's about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the f-word in about every sentence. He is so over-the-top, though, that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice, I know almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts. Visually and audibly, this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors, creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock 'n roll songs, and a bunch of bizarre noises (sound effects). From discussions I've had, this seems to be a film people love or hate. There is not much room for middle ground. Lynch has done much "nicer" films such as "The Straight Story," crazier films ("Wild At Heart," "Eraserhead") and classier movies ("The Elephant Man") but this will be his trademark film: the one above others he will be remembered for, good or bad.
Jeffrey Beaumont returns to his small town home when his father has an accident and ends up in hospital.  A quiet walk home changes his perceptions forever when he discovers a human ear in the long grass.  He reports it to the police but decides to make some enquires himself with the help of the officer's daughter Sandy.  The trail begins with the mysterious Dorothy Vallens and drags Jeffrey into the unseen underworld of Frank Booth.For the majority of people, you either like Lynch or you dislike him. Personally I like the majority of his work, I love the sense of normalcy that he can create and slowly change to reveal a darkness that is worryingly close to the surface.  That is the case here, beginning with a blue sky, white picket fence vision of small town America the camera drops into the grass to see a torrent of bugs scrambling just under the surface.  In the same way the film follows Jeffrey's journey into the underbelly of his home town.In some ways this is one of the easiest Lynch films to get into  here the darkness is not a wide world of demons as in Fire Walk With Me, but is one man and his associates who can be overcome.  The darkness is therefore accessible to all but is laced with just enough weirdness to disturb  my favourite scene is where Frank takes Jeffrey to see Ben, it is just a little unsettling.  In hand with this is the fact that it is easily one of his most optimistic films, the good angel in Jeffrey's life is a strong character and the ending is one of certainty rather than open to interpretation  that robin has about a clear a meaning as it can.MacLachlan is well used as Jeffrey.  He is wide eyed and innocent even when being sucked into the underworld.  Dern plays `all-American' well but doesn't have the complexity of MacLachlan in the script.  Rossellini has a challenging role and carries it off quite well  I didn't fully understand her character but I don't know if that was my fault or hers.  Of course the film belongs to Hopper who is terrifyingly unstable.  Without a doubt he is a monster and you never are left in any doubt as to his state of mind.  For an example of his work here watch the scene where Stockwell (in a wonderfully weird cameo) sings and Hopper clearly falls to pieces.Although I prefer Fire Walk With Me, I do think that this is Lynch's best film.  It is weird without going totally overboard and it allows us to sink into the underworld gradually without sudden falls.  Hopper controls every scene he is in, but the meeting of wholesome and weird is perfectly delivered and is trademark Lynch.
I think I get it, and there's some very interesting concepts that could make for a great movie, but the execution ruined most of it for me. It's quite shocking to me this is genuinely considered by many to be one of the best films of all time. Don't get me wrong, there's aspects that deserve praise but most of the movie isn't even that well made in my opinion. The entire movie feels so stilted and clunky, from the performances, dialogue, editing, etc. You know you've failed when you make a literal rape scene unintentionally funny. None of the acting is good, honestly feeling like a student film. It's baffling to me this would get an Oscar nomination for it's directing. Are there good elements to the directing? Yes, it's pretty decently shot, it has some good symbolism, but mostly everything else fails. Some scenes feel like the actors weren't even directed. Sometimes it's hammy, and other times it's under-acted. Also I really dislike the pauses and whispering in some scenes. Can you really call a movie that makes a rape scene unintentionally funny well directed? The characters are all very thin and basic, they could've used so much more development to further strengthen the themes. It's like they only got the most basic elements to make these characters, but forgot to actually delve into them. It feels bare bones, and while the bones are strong It forgot the meat to truly support it. Not that all need much development, but most of the characters feel unrealistic, and unbelievable without much development. The plot is basic, bland, and even contrived at times. There's nothing that special or original about it, so the execution is what would set it apart, and it does by being mostly stilted and silly in all the wrong places. I honestly found most of the movie to be unenjoyable. I also believe it could've been shorter and had a tighter edit to at least be more enjoyable. Though at the same time it could've also been longer to further flesh out certain aspects of the film. The script feels like an early draft for a potentially great movie. Ironically Lynch's direction feels wrong for this type of movie. Yes, there are great elements in this movie, but the execution is middling at best. This movie is like the opposite of the opening scene, with the disgusting cockroaches at the top covering the rich grass brimming with potential that never quite got out. I would argue some of this movie is badly made, but I still gave it a 5.5/10 because I recognize it does have some great stuff deep in it. Maybe I really didn't get it, and Lynch's style isn't for me, but again, to me for the subject matter in this movie to be this badly executed is not a stylistic choice but an obvious flaw with the direction and movie. This is something I'll probably revisit when I watch more Lynch films, I hope I'm wrong about it, but this isn't a good start from his filmography for me.(5.5/10)Note: This is an old review I wrote last year that I always meant to expand especially after watching more Lynch and if I rewatch this film, but for now I thought I might as well post this.

The atmosphere created is the very meaning of scintillating and suspense levels are to the maximum. The story- one of the most coherent and accessible of any Lynch film- is always interesting and entertaining, the detective story elements are genuinely suspenseful and at times scary, Lynch has never directed a tenser scene than the climax here.Lynch's direction is superb; along with Mulholland Drive it contains some of his best. The characters all serve a point to the story and they are very interestingly written, in the case of Frank Booth, one of the most evil and fascinating villains on films, iconic. The acting is superb as well, especially with Dennis Hopper who's terrifyingly sadistic and sometimes hilarious, he is very over the top but in a gleefully enjoyable way. Kyle MacLachlan has never been in a better film or given a better performance than here, he's certainly not had a character as interesting either, Laura Dern is great and sensual Isabella Rossellini has a challenging role that she plays to truly devastating effect. Look out for an oddball but memorable appearance from Dean Stockwell as well. Overall, a strange but utterly mesmerising masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox
What surprised me was how very different this was from the two other great David Lynch films I'd seen: "Lost Highway" and "The Straight Story", which are in turn very different from one another. I'd been told by a disappointed David Lynch fan, back in 1997, that the only reason I was so deeply impressed with "Lost Highway" was that I hadn't seen "Bue Velvet", in which he does much the same kind of thing better. "Blue Velvet" may indeed be better (I wouldn't want to say), but in no respect is it the same kind of thing. (The only instance I've encountered so far of Lynch making the same film twice is "Lost Highway" being remade as "Mulholland Drive", which partly accounts for the latter film being so stale and uninvolving.)"Blue Velvet" is a simple amateur sleuthing story, but the genius is in the telling of it. It's hard to avoid the feeling that something supernatural is somehow involved, although it isn't, and we know that it isn't. It looks and feels as though we're watching the world through a special enchanted (or cursed) prism: the image has been pulled apart, ALMOST into two distinct images, with the elements of pure evil and pure wholesomeness now distinct from one another, sitting just millimetres apart.Unrelated to this, but still contributing to the intense suspense and the overall creepiness, is Lynch's ability to make us familiar with a few ordinary locations, which grow more sinister - or at least more meaningful - every time we see them, until the sight of a simple concrete stairwell in the dark is enough to make us start to panic.
Title: Blue Velvet (1986)Director: David Lynch Cast: Isabella Rosellini, Kyle Mac Lachlan, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern Review: David Lynch films are paintings come to life, this has very much to do with the fact that Lynch himself is a painter and he brings that artistic point of view to his film making. Like a good painting, his movies tell a story, which much like an abstract painting, is not always easy to figure out. But what a treat it is to try.Blue Velvet is a story about a young man returning to his hometown to visit his father who is sick in the hospital. Upon his return he stumbles upon a frightening discovery: a human ear lying on the grass as he walks through the forest behind his parents home. He then takes it upon himself to discover where this ear came from and discovers that that ear will be the reason why he discovers that this is in fact a very strange and dangerous world in which we live in.Lynch is synonymous with the strange and unusual and Blue Velvet is a good example of this. For those who have ventured into Lynchian territory with films like Mullholland Dr. or Lost Highway get ready for some more crazy imagery and messed up situations. But Ill be honest this time around, even though the situations and images are very very surreal and strange the story itself is pretty easy to understand. Lost Highway remains a total mystery to me to this day, Mullholland Dr. I had to watch about 6 times to figure out....but Blue Velvet though equally as strange and fascinating as those films mentioned, is actually easy to follow and understand.I loved Kyle MacLachlans character and it was very interesting to see him go through the changes he goes through after he makes his discoveries. He isn't quite the same anymore after he sees the things he sees and does the things he does. Loved that scene in which Laura Dern tries to let him see that even though there's some crazy things in this world there's some good bound to show up sooner or later. Laura Derns character was beautiful and innocent, the one thing that could bring balance to MacLachlans character. By far the most interesting and memorable thing in this film is Dennis Hoppers character, yes my friends, I'm talking about that crazy, demented, sex-crazed freak known as Frank Booth.Frank Booth is one of those characters that just oozes with evil. You don't feel like its this actor playing some villain, when that happens you totally stop believing that said villain is dangerous. Not so here. Hopper looks, breaths and speaks pure evil! Your kind of scared that there might actually be people like him out in the real world. His scenes and dialog is truly disturbing stuff....."Ill f##C@ anything that moooves!" I loved the visual aspect of the film which was -as is usual in a Lynch film- extremely beautiful. We may be looking at sliced human ears and demented sex freaks...but everything is photographed within the context of beautiful haunting colors, exotic plays of shadows and lights. Great visuals. The music is incredible as well. Lynch seems to be fond of lounge singers cause very much like he did in Mullholland Drive in Club Silencio, we get another sequence much like that one, with Isabella Rosellini singing us "Blue Velvet" the title song. And there's also a sequence which is very very humorous yet strange and alluring....Dean Stockwell singing Roy Orbinsons "In Dreams". Awesome sequence, one of the most memorable sequences on this film or any other Lynch film. When that scene comes on, you'll be transported to another time and place. What time and place it is Ill leave it up to you.All in all a great Lynch film not to be missed. A masterpiece that lets me know why Lynch is one of the greatest American directors ever to be in the business of making bizarro, beautiful cinema.Rating: 5 out of 5 (and very very much so!)
One has to watch a David Lynch movie just to say you have seen one. This was actually nominated for an Academy Award and won many others, so it is probably as good as any to see. I tried Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, but couldn't get more than a couple of scenes before I gave up. I was able to hang in there for this.There has to be something there, but I just don't get it. The man has four Academy Award nominations for his films. He must be doing something that I just don't see.Closeups of bugs in the grass or the inside of an ear is not stirring cinematography to me.An example of the dialog you have to endure in this film:Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan): You're a neat girl. Sandy Williams (Laura Dern): So are you... I mean, you're a neat guy.This wasn't random, but typical. And, what's with the "chicken walk"?Maybe some think it is worth enduring to see Isabella Rossellini nude walking like a zombie.I was worth enduring just to know what a David Lynch film is like, and to avoid them in the future.
To watch Blue Velvet for the first time 31 years after its original release is a treat of unexpected proportions. I'm not going to tell about the story because, I'm sure, each one of us could tell it in very different ways. The blandness of Kyle MacLachland here is a major plus. It's not him that rivet us but his circumstances. And the circumstances are truly riveting, terrifying, unpredictable and gloriously cinematic. Dennis Hopper is superb, disgustingly so and Isabella Rossellini creates a character that was totally new to me. Related to many others but new, disturbingly so. Dean Stockwell has a moment that I know already will stay in my mind for ever. I'm so glad I finally saw it.
Back in the days when David Lynch's movies used to be coherent, this film proves to be one of the most powerful in a long line of odd and strange films. I felt all of the actors were exceptional in this film, reflecting the power and evil in Dennis Hopper's character. I can't see anyone else in this role, and Hopper proved once again he is the go-to guy when it comes to portraying a lunatic. Lynch's cinematography and artistic endeavors fit in so perfectly with each other, the film reeks of noir and suspense. An excellent film to watch for any first time Lynch watchers.
When college student Jeffrey Beaumont's father is hospitalised he returns home to what at first appears to be the Perfect American Town... he soon discovers that it is anything but. On a piece of wasteland he finds a severed human ear which he takes to Detective John Williams, a friend of his fathers. Williams' daughter Sandy approaches Jeffrey and tells him she overheard her father talking about a possible connection to singer Dorothy Vallens; Jeffrey decides to investigate. This leads to him getting caught in a very dangerous place with some incredibly disturbing characters; most notably Frank Booth.This is very much a David Lynch film; the situation has a not-quite-real feel without being quite as weird as 'Twin Peaks'... it is far more disturbing though. Kyle MacLachlan is impressive as the ordinary Jeffrey caught in an extraordinary situation but it is Dennis Hopper who steals every scene he is in as the Frank... one of cinema's more disturbing creations. The way the story unfolds creates a real sense of danger and its ending is far from clear till almost the end. The rest of the cast are solid; most notably Isabella Rossellini as femme fatale Dorothy and Laura Dern as the innocent Sandy. Due to the disturbing nature of many scenes, which include sexual violence, this certainly won't be for everybody but if you like disturbing neo-noir then this is definitely a must see.
There is far more to 'Blue Velvet' than meets the eye.  You can't label this as drama, satire, or black comedy.  It just doesn't work.'Blue Velvet' is an example of our world's disarray.  This film is VERY genius in its portrayal.  We see a hokey, innocent town that yields a dark secret.The symbolism is great.  White picket fences, waving fireman, hokey acting, and a sunny day show the apparent innocence.  But a stroke, black insects, a candle getting blown out, etc. show us something else.I love how when we see the innocence, everything is hokey.  The music, acting, dialogue... everything.  But when the darkness appears, everything becomes serious.  The script improves, the acting is better... everything. That's something that was missed by most viewers.David Lynch is brilliant, but he also has a great sense of humor.  Jokes aren't funny... absurdity is funny.Lightness and darkness seemingly coexist in this lumber town... each in their own place.  When a curious fellow returns home, he disrupts the balance and the two forces go to war.  Yet, we don't really even know which side he's on.  I love how Jeffrey always wears black and white.  I love all the symbology of this film.If you haven't seen this yet, break away from the Hollywood cookie cutter movies and prepare to have your mind challenged and entertained.Makes a fun party movie, too.   ;o)10/10
The sexual revolution in film came some ten years after the label's coinage in the late Sixties. It probably began with Last Tango in Paris. Directed by the acclaimed Bernardo Bertolucci, Last Tango is notorious for a sex scene involving Marlon and roughly a third of a stick of butter. Theretofore sex in film could potentially be used as a means of revealing the lightest or the darkest character's traits: primarily, vulnerability, instinct, sadism and impulse. Blue Velvet is a good example of a movie using such a dynamic. Blue Velvet is not a film that is easily appreciated. Likewise, it is not a film that is easily forgotten. It is a timeless controversy, and it is a vision demanding attention if not praise. Set in a small American town, Blue Velvet is a dark, sensuous mystery involving the intertwining lives of four very different individuals. The film's painful realism reminds us that we are not immune to the disturbing events which transpire in Blue Velvet's sleepy community. There is a darker side of life waiting for us all. And as a critic said 'you either think it's dementedly wild at heart or a lost highway to nowhere'. Even some eighteen years after the release of Blue Velvet its vision remains wildly adamant relative to the stride of other works of contemporary noir. There have been many films about suburban crime, but none as dangerously imposing as this. Why is that so? If Blue Velvet might not be labeled as a masterpiece one has to acknowledge that there are in this movie a lot of so called 'masterpiece element' and if Blue Velvet will never be considered as Mr. Lynch best feature, I personally can see a lot of David Lynch's genius flowing in that movie.First of all, the way David Lynch makes Blue Velvet increasingly disturbing is a perfect example of how pristine the dynamics of weirdness and tension are built (remember Eraserhead and Elephant Man). Through this process Mr. Lynch indeed deconstructs the audience expectations. The film setting and mood are introduced in an exposition lifted directly from older films (there are numerous references to It's A Wonderful Life). In result the film is initially expected to follow a particular path. The way Mr. Lynch associate elements of classic narrative methodology and 'his dynamics of noir' (previously explained) appears to be original at worst 'avant gardiste' at best. Second of all, the opposition between the creepiness of the plot and the setting of it is definitely for me a masterpiece element. The film is set in Lumberton. This does not represent a quaint, small town by similarity; it is one. Lumberton is filled with characters that are completely typical. I can almost see the cops eating doughnuts in the coffee shop and the local football star dating the head cheerleader. This typicality is definitely not out of coincidence but of intention. In fact these characters function to punctuate the story, not to distinguish it. The 'infamous' individuality of Lynch's vision is established in the darker side of Lumberton. Our perspective throughout the film is fixed on Jeffery, and is deliberately biased by his good nature. Jeffery is portrayed with great subtlety by Kyle MacLachlan (FBI agent from "Twin Peaks"). He is paired with Sandy (Laura Dern), the daughter of a neighborhood investigator who epitomizes to perfection the 'girl-next-door'; in Blue Velvet it is her literal function. Completing this diverse list of roles is a haunting and brief performance by Dean Stockwell as well as Dennis Hopper who creates a flabbergasting portrait of unrepentant and irredeemable evil. The confrontation or those characters or the collision among themselves makes for a mesmerizing experience. Once again Mr. Lynch succeeds in the masterful exercise of controlling the audience's attention. Most of us will not quite know what to make of it and we can disagree on the value of such a cinematic experience. However audacious, erotic, disturbing, haunting are adjectives that will always be linked with Blue Velvet. The 'Thriller' has just been re-invented by Mr. Lynch right in front of our eyes.
I think that this is the movie that took me through five layers of enlightenment.If you've known me for more than 0.2 seconds, you'll probably know that David Lynch is my favourite director ever. His works never cease to astound me, and of all of his already-perfect films, I would have to say that Blue Velvet really is not only the best film that he's made, but the best film of the 20th century, if not of all time.There's something so stylistically beautiful and genre-defying about Blue Velvet. Something so sleek and so enchanting, combined with Lynch's classic horror, captivates you just like the eponymous song.What's interesting about Blue Velvet is that even though it's one of Lynch's most confusing works, and the storyline isn't as strange as one of his later films (say, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive), it still manages to be so incredibly disturbing and mind-bendingly horrific, to the point that sometimes you feel obliged to have to watch through your fingers.Blue Velvet peels back the layers of the American dream to reveal a dark underworld that will haunt your mind for days. That signature opening with the unnaturally blood-red roses against a white picket fence and an artificially bright sky sets the theme of the slightly too-perfect image of suburbia that continues through the film, and contrasts jarringly with the things we later see and find. And that gorgeous song. Blue Velvet echoes throughout the film, and whenever you hear it you cannot help but be entranced.There was not a single bad performance in this movie. Isabella Rossellini as the beautiful and troubled Dorothy Vallens, Laura Dern as "the girl next door", Dennis Hopper as the psychotic Frank Booth, and, of course, Kyle MacLachlan as our innocent young protagonist. How did none of these incredibly talented people get any sort of Oscar recognition? How did this movie generally not get any sort of Oscar recognition besides just a nomination for Best Director? Come on! Best Picture nom, at least!This movie is certainly not for everyone, what with how horrifically graphic and disturbing it gets, every now and then, but let me tell you: when all is said and done, it really is a cinematic masterpiece and is my favourite movie of all time, and I don't see that changing any time soon.-Sasha.
Oh boy, what a weird movie. How can I even comment it.David Lynch films are not easy to get into (at least for me). Usually I don't like them upon first viewing, but at least Mulholland Drive has slowly become my super favorite. I don't expect Blue Velvet to climb as high, but there is some grower potential.I liked the beginning the best, when it's like a murder mystery. But then it goes crazy in all directions and I don't really know what to think. But some things are certain: the cinematography is beautiful and atmosperic, and there is a lot of great acting. Dennis Hopper is totally crazy in this film, but others aren't bad either.If you like strange movies, see this one. But only if you can stomach some violence and sexual weirdness as well. I will probably get an urge to want to see it again at some point because it has such a distinct atmosphere and style.
After hearing all the hype of how this is an artistic, intellectual & enigmatic film, I figured I would love it to death. Instead, I found myself *wishing* for death.Roger Ebert got it right when he called it "a story that's marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots. The director is either denying the strength of his material or trying to defuse it by pretending it's all part of a campy in-joke."It begins impressively with excellent cinematic technique and symbolism, but as soon as the first words are spoken, the film begins to sag with ridiculous, predictable and juvenile dialogue. The plot itself is tediously linear and simple, like an average Hardy Boys episode: high school kids take on the criminal underworld!But, oh, this is no Hardy Boys episode. Director David Lynch made sure of that, by injecting plenty of profanity, gore, and nudity. (And just as an aside to all you drooling fans of Isabella Rosselini... TRUST me, she & her beer-belly look awful in this movie! Save yourselves the shattered fantasies.)The scenes are extremely clumsy and overt, as if Lynch doesn't give us enough credit for figuring it out ourselves. I'll give you one example: In one scene, Laura Dern and Dune Boy (forgot his name) are sitting in a car in front of a church. Laura starts talking about her dream of God. The music switches to a church pipe organ. Then they drive off, and the camera zooms in on the church and holds the frame for 3 full seconds. (...hmmm, d'ya git the feelin he's a-trying to tell us sumthin? I dunno, Vern. Lez rewind it and watch it again.)True, compared to the Hollywood tripe that was the standard in 1986, _Blue Velvet_ is unique. But that doesn't mean it's good. I would advise you to watch Lynch's 1990 film _Wild at Heart_ in which he achieved a greater degree poetry, having refined his style somewhat. Well, you have been warned!
With Blue Velvet, David Lynch made a film that was so pure to his original vision that it would become the archetype of his work for the next fifteen years.  Here, Lynch cast his ever probing, surrealist gaze upon small town middle America, and for the first time in a US film, showed the audience the darker side to what was often depicted as nothing more than the birth place of apple pie. We are drawn into the story almost immediately, with what would seem like a simple depiction of small town life, but the use of slow-motion hints that there is something not quite right with what we are looking at.  So by the time Lynch has pushed his camera through the soft green grass of a regular front lawn, only to show us the slithering insects that hide in the darkness, we know that we are about to enter a very dark world.Blue Velvet is a world filled with not only darkness, but also ambiguity. The characters of this world are constantly hiding behind some kind of façade, be it the wardrobe doors that practicing teenage voyeur Jeffrey peers from behind as he watches Dorothy and Frank interact, or something as simple as the make-up worn by Ben.  Everything suggests to us that these characters inhabit a world at night, a world away from the life they live in the day.  As the film moves closer and closer to the climax Jeffrey begins to feel more of a connection with Frank, having to go to some very dark places within his psyche.  However Lynch's message, that underneath the normal persona of a regular human being is a repressed pervert laying in wait, or whatever point he is making doesn't really translate well.  Not least to today's audience.  Blue Velvet is very much a film of its time, that time being the mid-eighties, with aids paranoia everywhere, it's easy to see this metaphor for the dangers of sex and love within the films turgid dreamscapes.  But beneath this message hides a strong detective story, a modern day neo-noir that delivers interesting twists and a controversial pay-off with it's almost fairytale climax.  This is the film David Lynch got right, proceeding to make great films that where all personal, but completely different in terms of style and substance from one another.  Blue Velvet is a great film, with some fine (albeit bizarre) performances, still challenging to this day, If only Lynch hadn't gone on to spend the rest of his career re-making it.
In some ways, this reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's reaction to directing Spartacus, a movie he had no creative control on and found deadening, by directing Lolita as his follow up. For Lynch, Dune was a draining experience of constant compromise that led to the end result of a less than stellar film, so he followed it up with an intensely personal film at a much smaller scale where he had full control in Blue Velvet.Blue Velvet tells the story of Kyle MacLachlan's Jeffrey who investigates a weird crime and potential murder in a small town with a logging industrial footprint, finding that the thin veneer of Americana hides a seedy underbelly of corruption, sex, and murder. Sound familiar? Yeah, it's a prototype of Twin Peaks.Anyway, Jeffrey Beaumont has come home from college to the small town of Lumbertron, North Carolina after his father had a heart attack. Walking back from the hospital one day, he discovers a human ear in a field. Taking it to his neighbor, a police detective, and learning some key pieces of information from the detective's daughter, Sandy, Jeffrey enters into a dangerous world that he might not survive. His entry point is a lounge singer, Dorothy Vallens, who was under surveillance by the police on an unrelated matter that got brought up to Detective Williams. Jeffrey sneaks in, hides in her closet, and watches a horrid display of sadism and masochism when Frank Booth shows up to extract what he wants from Dorothy.These two characters, Dorothy and Frank, represent an extreme of choice open to Jeffrey, the young man still figuring out who he wants to be. On the other end are his father in the hospital and Sandy. Sandy is the good girl, the daughter of a good policeman, who wants to love and be loved. Dorothy and Frank represent a more dangerous, exciting, and degrading life of abuse, and what Jeffrey discovers is that for all he was brought up to believe in one code of behavior, he has it within himself to fall into Frank's lifestyle. That comes to the fore for him when he makes love to Dorothy and he hits her at her insistence.That leads me to this very obvious observation: Blue Velvet looks at a very ugly side of life, and it looks at it unflinchingly. However, what makes it most interesting is Lynch's ability to balance vastly different tones within the same scene. This was obvious in Eraserhead, but he had never really managed to deal in the same kind of tonal shifts with The Elephant Man and Dune, at least at the same level. Blue Velvet represents an extreme example of this, and quite possibly my single favorite scene in all of David Lynch's filmography does it in this film.Jeffrey has gotten in too deep, and Frank has discovered him. Frank has every intention of intimidating and threatening Jeffrey, maybe even killing him. Frank Booth, you see, is a marvelous cinematic creation from both David Lynch and Dennis Hopper. He's a deranged freak killer who inhales amyl nitrite to enhance his sexual experiences (changed from helium in the script, which would have been hilarious but perhaps distractingly so) and has turned Dorothy into his sex slave by kidnapping her husband and child. Her husband is the proper owner of that ear that Jeffrey found. He is the only one to curse (aside from one single instance where Frank forces another to say it), and his dialogue is laced with profanity. He sticks out from everything around him all the time. He's like a force of nature, an elemental creation that has the motivation of a hurricane approaching a coastline. He is a purely destructive force manifested in a man, and his success as an onscreen villain has everything to do with Dennis Hopper. Fresh off of going sober after years of alcohol and drug abuse, Hopper knew he was on extremely thin ice and that this part was a goldmine. He gave the part his all, imbuing Frank with such interesting malevolence that he's always fascinating to simply watch.Frank's malevolent best and the movie's deft balance of wildly different tones come together in one particular scene best. Frank takes Jeffery and Dorothy to Ben's whorehouse where he is keeping Dorothy's husband and child. The scene as Dorothy cries in the other room at the sight of her son while Frank demands cold Pabst Blue Ribbon from one of the women and Ben mouths the words to Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" is such an expert combination of menace, terror, and hilarity at the same time.The movie's one flaw, I think, is Dorothy. Isabella Rosellini threw herself into this role, baring herself literally and figuratively in portraying a woman in and of an abusive relationship, but I think she's a bit underwritten. I would imagine that she's given more time to breathe and exist in the two hours of deleted scenes, an hour of which Criterion managed to release on the Blu-ray, but she has the makings of such a complex character who could center an entire film on her own instead of being a supporting character in Jeffrey's story of becoming his own man. There's more to her, and I think a lot of it ended up on the cutting room floor.Jeffrey, however, is the main character and everything that happens in this movie is about him discovering the truth of the world around him and about himself. He could be a good, quiet man like his father, watering his lawn by hand, or he could be like Frank, abusing Dorothy at her own insistence. The resolution is all about him making that choice, and it's not about being a pure version of either. He has to do something awful in order to choose the right path.Blue Velvet is also one of the best combinations of image and narrative Lynch has. Thinking of the final major sequence, where Jeffery shows up at Dorothy's apartment to find the man in yellow standing with an exposed head wound, Dorothy's husband tied up in a chair, and the television playing, Lynch's creates this surrealistic moment that feels extreme and of the reality of the movie at the same time. There's also the look of Dorothy singing on stage, draped in a blue dress with a red curtain behind her that pops in the frame. The movie is really visually fascinating and eye catching all the way through.Aside from the underwritten nature of Dorothy, this is Lynch reclaiming who he is as a filmmaker in grand fashion. He's telling a distinctly American story born from his own experiences growing up, informed by his own distinct method of storytelling that borders on dream logic.
Blue Velvet is extremely upsetting and disturbing, and yet I can't take my eyes away from it. I always feel dirty watching this movie. Like it's something I shouldn't be watching. Like I need a shower after.The performances are all great, but for me the standouts are Laura Dern and Dennis Hopper.Hopper in particular is amazing as Frank. If the"f word" was a person, that would be Frank. Just an absoulety despicable human being in every way. He's as repulsive as he is fascinating.That's the film in a nutshell. Repulsive, yet fascinating. I hate watching it but I love that feeling.
I've always contended that David's Lynch writes most of his scripts after he has awakened from bad dreams. This is the story of a nice young guy who has pretty much all he could want. One day, he makes the mistake of his life, getting involved with an older woman (Isabella Rosellini) and all the fallout from that almost destroys him. Soon he is in the hands of some of the most eccentric and dangerous people we could ever meet. Mainly, Dennis Hopper, a psychotic, who has a claim on the woman. Soon the boy's life is not his own and he can't seem to escape. The world he is in is the total opposite of the one he had but a few weeks before. So much has already been written about this film. I will only say that Hopper is one of the most threatening presences I have ever witnessed. As I watched this film the first time, I had all I could do to stay in the theater. There's an overriding sickness here where we want to grab this kid and move him to another continent to get him away; but we feel we still have to watch.
It has its good points. When Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) sings the title song in the club, the film exudes wonderful atmosphere. Other oldies-but-goodies songs also are enjoyable to listen to. And the film's color cinematography, with its vibrant hues, is quite effective. Otherwise, this film is just awful.Set in small town America in the early 1960s, the film opens with a young man named Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) who finds a human ear, while strolling through the woods one day. Jeffrey's curiosity propels the plot through a convoluted story involving strange characters, sex, drugs, and murder. It's all rather seedy. And the film's excessive violence is annoying.The story's inciting incident is not remotely plausible. The plot makes no sense. Some of the dialogue is sophomoric. And the characters are dreadful. The Frank Booth character (Dennis Hopper) is so outlandish as to be cartoonish. His use of an oxygen mask is nothing but a gimmick. Hopper makes matters worse by overplaying the role. The Ben character (Dean Stockwell) is bizarre, and not in a good way. And Dorothy is an emotional wreck, whiny and easily manipulated.The film's casting and acting are wretched. Kyle MacLachlan is as bad in this film as he was in "Dune" (1984). He's bland, lacks suitable expressiveness, and is annoyingly nerdy. If he were any stiffer, he could pass for a mannequin. I don't know who was worse: dull MacLachlan or farcical Dennis Hopper. Rossellini tries to act, but her performance comes across as comically melodramatic which, when combined with Hopper's histrionics, renders scenes that are unintentionally funny.The film's moody atmosphere makes for suitable cinematic style. But the script, the direction, the casting, and the acting are so bad that the end result is a cartoon for spaced-out adults. And the emphasis on gratuitous violence suggests that Director David Lynch was making an effort to distract viewers from the film's hokey contrivances. I'd say he succeeded rather well.
Young man visits his family in cozy hometown, but after finding a severed ear in a nearby field he follows a trail of corruption, sadism and murder. David Lynch-directed torment, full of bright and beguiling colors, features many of his now-familiar themes (the city vs. the suburbs, the evil which lurks under our everyday existence), but it was a lot more provocative in 1986 than today. And, since time has not been kind to the presentation, attentions are more focused on the performances, which are variable. Dennis Hopper, as the resident psychopath, really goes out a limb and performs his role with gusto; it's an overscaled, though admittedly singular achievement, yet also a horribly unpleasant one, and you can't shake Hopper away once he's off-screen (and when he returns, so do the bad vibes). The film's surreal, daydreamy mood is well-captured, as is the nightmare-in-the-daytime ambiance, but the picture's atmosphere has to go a long way towards making "Blue Velvet" worth watching again. It just hasn't hel
Dark. Twisted. Fragile. Dangerous. Delinquent characters mingle in downtown hotels and outbuildings - a stones throw away from suburbia. Is this a horror film?
"It's a strange world, isn't it?."David Lynch is one of those big, gaping holes in my cinematic experience. Haven't seen one movie he's done up until now, even though I knew how highly regarded his work is. Blue Velvet is the first Lynch film I watch and review, with hopefully more to come in the near future.Blue Velvet is a mystery thriller film which follows Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan), a high school student who takes some time off school since his father has fallen ill and got hospitalized. While he walks home from the hospital he finds a severed human ear, and from there on he gets tangled in this surreal, horrifying world that lies under the calm suburban surface of his town, Lumberton.Lots of good things to say about this one, tbh. Let's start with the soundtrack and the score, which are both fantastic. Beyond being pleasent to listen to or fitting to each scene like a glove to a hand (vibe-wise), the soundtrack here has some connections that are quite creative to the film itself. Mysteries of Love, Love Letters and of course the song Blue Velvet itself give wonderful insight to the things that happen within the scenes in which they're played, and again, in great ways. Quite hard for me to remeber the last time that a soundtrack added so much to a film-watching experience for me.The cast is also tight as hell, and the lead actors all have their amazing moments (well...Laura Dern is decent but she's probably the least impressive off the main cast) - MacLachlan, Denis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini are all amazing here. Denis Hopper especially, in my opinion. His deranged, absolutely insane performance is quite legendary and very versetile here.Now folks, to the content. I think that the strength of Blue Velvet is not in its intricate philosophy, but rather in the story it tells, the characters it builds and the relationships between them. The script is so on point, so subtle in the way that it emphasizes psychological characteristics of characters here, especially with Dorothy and Frank. The characters here sure will give you a lot to think about, I guarantee you.I also like the surreal use of color and "dream logic" quite a lot. It's simple, but it's really effective. The cinematography isn't mind blowing but it's really good and it has a lot of style and personality, which I appreciate a lot.I have two issues with the film that are worth adressing to, though no issue here is fatal. First, the pacing of the film until the first closet scene is quite slow, and Lynch takes his time with the setup of eveything. I get why it's necessary but I just feel like this bit of the film is the shallow water in which you walk before you can deep-dive, and it feels like a drag a little bit, that's all.The second issue is Sandy and Jeffrey's interactions in the beginning of the film. I kinda feel like the romantic tension that's supposed to be there just feels awkward at first, like, it doesn't feel like a genuine, real-life interaction. Again, the dream logic thing may explain it (The chicken walk thing is sooo random) and it gets a lot better later in the film, but the beginning of it, at least, is rather weird.Overall, though, Blue Velvet got me hyped about the rest of the journey I'm gonna go through with Lynch. It's unique, well written and it has tons of personality. Some interesting characters to think about just before the sandman will cast some sand in your eyes and put you to sleep. I like it a lot. Feeling an 8.5/10 on this one.
David Lynch's (Oscar-nominated for directing here) typical strangeness runs amok in this over-rated would-be-thriller that only comes to life when show-stopper Dennis Hopper is on screen. Lumberton, USA seems to be a typical small town, but there is darkness there. A severed ear is found one day by Kyle MacLachlan and he decides to start his own investigation with the police chief's daughter (the equally dull Laura Dern) when they come to the conclusion that the cops will never find out the real truth. Together they learn that there are really dangerous underground figures in their sleepy little town. There is the mysterious Isabella Rossellini, a nightclub singer who swears that her son has been kidnapped by drug-addicted sadist Hopper. Naturally Rossellini's highly sexual behavior bewitches MacLachlan and he gets involved in a situation that he may not be able to escape from. Once again Lynch's direction is the greatest asset here. He turns a film that could have been a pure mess into a fascinating movie-going experience. However with that said, his direction and uneven screenplay also hinder at times. Rossellini does the best she can with a character that is a bit too flat to be totally believable. In the end, Lynch's whackiness and Hopper's scene-stealing are the main attractions here
The only thing that works is the music.
Dune is a muddling, dull feudal drama dressed up in an elaborate sci-fi costume. The film tries desperately to elevate the basic messianic archetype with excess futurism in hopes to disguise its banal core. 
Unless you know the book you may be wondering what to make of all this electronic agitation. 
For all my half-hearted hedging, I can see Lynch's Dune lasting the repertory course a lot longer than Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings or Fred Haines' Steppenwolf. 
Under a barrage of incomprehensible dialogue, hieratic rites, inscrutable encounters, confused battles and cornea-peeling special effects, my mind steadily contracted, until at the end of the 135-minutes it felt like the fibre-dry centre of a bad walnut.
Even if the plot has a serpentine complexity, the visual Impact of David Lynch s direction is never less than dazzling.
Dune is ripe for cult adoration.
The onslaught of singular imagery is engaging, even if it's unfocused and confused.
a predominantly inert adaptation
As with many things lousy, this acquired a cult following over the years, but it's hardly worthy.
A reasonably good-looking failure with a fantastic musical score and a lot of terribly confused-looking actors.
There are many aspects of 'Dune' that work...But what 'Dune' isn't is fun. It's as if humor has been bleached from the future.
No matter how hard it tries to make Herbert understandable to those who find the saga resistible, or even to make Dune hang together for devoted fans, there is an overwhelming sense that this is familiar cinematic territory.
Of course, this movie is very flawed. But Kenneth McMillan laughing, preying on his victims and floating in the air ... I saw this movie at the premiere and I have never forgotten those images.
David Lynch's grand, deeply flawed take on the Frank Herbert contains moments of sci-fi/fantasy glory intermixed with a ton of stilted acting and not-very-special effects.
The final product feels like a film made for fans of the book.
This is a film that doesn't dramatically harness the vast forces it's gesturing at, but trundles determinedly along with very little variation of tone or pace.
The convoluted narrative ultimately slips away from Lynch and in that failure lives the suspicion that Frank Herbert's novel is beyond adaptation.
The first 15 minutes of this movie is exactly what you'd get if you gave $40 million to the guy who did Eraserhead to make an epic sci-fi movie... but I absolutely love it.
Remains a visually audacious curiosity, which needs to be seen to be believed.
my first intro to the dune universe, not as good as the 2021 film, but not bad.
Not as visually appealing as the 2021 version (which only shows part 1 of the book), but it manages well to compress the complex story into one movie. It is worthwhile to watch both the normal theatrical version as well as the extended, which contains 40min of additional footage.
Jak jakieś streszczenie. Niesamowicie nudna praca kamery. Brak emocji. Słabe aktorsko. Jakby teatralny klimat. Śmieszne efekty specjalne. Stary ten chłopiec
Classic. I like it! 
A Classic of its genre, an original. New studio generations need to stop trying to remake it and copy it, and come up with their own new ideas.
It's the best. David Lynch makes art. You can pick it apart but the sum of it's parts creates something deep, mysterious, and incredible. This movie will forever be one of the great films of all time.
The greatest terrible movie ever made.
I can stand the aged special effects, but not the chaotic plot.  I'm sure it's the distributor's fault rather than David Lynch's.
The overall movie feels like a successful failure in adapting a monumental story ... especially in comparison with the latest adaptation. But, what makes this version unique is that David Lynch managed to make some scenes unforgettable ... they are still haunting me, until today. Looking at the version of Denis this kinda lacks, the movie and the storytelling in total are much better, but after leaving the cinema, only a few scenes remained as high points.
So, therefore one point above average for this
A unique movie, it is simultaneously entertaining (though, in all the wrong ways) and dull. Dune (1984) is an awful adaptation, whereas Denis Villeneuve was smart in splitting Dune into two parts and giving the source material time to breathe, Dune (1984) is a rushed mess. Every scene feels like adding another check to a grocery list, and the actors deliver their lines as if they're reading a grocery list. Either that, or their performances are extremely over the top. There are entire scenes where the Baron Harkonnen is laughing maniacally, and it's comical. This movie is entertaining in the wrong way, it's so bad and over the top that it borderlines parody, and yet it's simultaneously taking itself very seriously. The last hour is a rushed mess that has absolutely no emotional impact because we don't get to know any of the characters. Plot beats just fly by or are explained with narration, it leaves everything feeling very shallow. I can commend the practical sets in this film though, they are gorgeous to look at and so are some of the costumes. An absolute positive of this film are that it goes for a certain aesthetic and nails it for the most, of course a lot of it has aged, particularly the cgi. The design of the worms is very intimidating, and every scene with the worms are when the movie is at its most watchable. The score by Toto is impressive and epic, something the film never attains. Dune (1984) is an absolute mess, a film that definitely has entertainment value, but mostly for the wrong reasons
Some of the models and effects were amazing. Some were much less impressive. The print was very dirty. Some of the chroma key looked really bad. Shame that the sound was not surround. Very original and creative use of effects but not the best example of this sci-fi fantasy type. They tried to pack too much story in. It should have been a trilogy of shorter movies. An interesting story but I had real trouble following it. I liked the old-school effects but failed to connect to the story. Some interesting ideas sadly don't make up for plot confusion.
I can watch this film at least once a week. Not the best for folk who haven't read the books but just a spectacular film.
Yes, it is slow, it contains mistakes, for people who have not read the book it is confusing, Kyle Maclachan is a total miscast as Paul Atreides and the new one is more entertaining....but still, I love it....Lynch got the spirit of the book, it is surreal....not sure if I should recommend it...at your own risk but really, read the book!!!
If you like sci fi then you will love it! If you don't well don't have much to say watch with an open mind.
The movie is a fever dream. It's got Patrick Stewart and Max von Sydow but also a guy wearing swimming goggles as future scientific gear. Having seen this in the aftermath of the first entry in the Villeneuve adaptation, Dune is a strange combination of excessive exposition and terrible storytelling that takes the actual ideas and events that take place in Herbert's book but then stitches them back together in a nearly incomprehensible way; I understood the first half more because of familitarity with the most recent adaptation than anything else. Ridiculous overacting is everywhere (though Kyle Maclachlan's particular brand of quirkiness may have just been the impromptu casting call that landed him his role in Twin Peaks), and it's delivered by characters in strange sets and goofy costumes. The biggest saving graces of the film are that it can be placed firmly into 'so bad it's good' territory, and that the practical effects and modeling actually look pretty solid for the time being (just ignore any overlays). Once you think you've got a grasp of this film and the pieces are falling into place, you are treated to Baron Harkonnen strung on wires explaining to a prisoner how he has to milk a cat to survive. (2/5)
No matter which version of David Lynch's Dune you are seeing, you are in for an amazing journey. Lynch's unique style brings a lot of life into the characters. memorable visuals and an amazing soundtrack. custom design is brilliant and the sets are beautiful. feels like a true glimpse into the Dune universe. Lynch tries to tell as much of it as he can. True, I don't appreciate the story changes that he made but I understand why he made them. TL;DR watch IT!
Memorable characters and effects
The casting, the dialogues, the visuals, the music, the story line, the ambiance were all outstanding. Still to this day one of my favorite movies.
Dune has clumsy special effects and fight scenes, some motivations are questionable but Lynch shows his versatility, his surreal trademark is latent and story is at least interesting.
This film is for me one of the best science fiction films. I like this atmosphere on the border of the strange. The Midle Eastern inspired sets add a touch of originality and strangeness to this film. The actors are equiped with the necessary thickness for this great intergalactic epic. It doesn't matter that this film doesn't not fully conform to Franck Herbert's story (I have not read). For me, David Lynch made a really great movie, which have not to be ashamed in front of Star Wars or Blade runner
Perhaps we will never know if this version could have the same strengths as the current version (2021) were it not for the fact that director David Lynch - it was not his fault - worked on commission, with a gag and few creative freedoms. The result is a sterile monster that lacks a face and a brain, and pretended to be identical to Star Wars. No wonder the memory still gives Mr. Lynch spasms of shamFascinating yet messy storytelling with more exposition than action and some bizarre costume and visual effects concepts that push the boundaries of what was possible in 1984. Seems a bit of a missed opportunity as if they had dialled it back a notch this could've found commercial success rather than its niche cult slot. Very entertaining for fans of sci fi fantasy movie
Either way, It's still a nightmare of a script with way too many awful looking special effects and makeup designs that just don't work
A guilty pleasure of mine. Special effects are terrible but the movie is saved by the sets and performances, in addition to a great score by Toto. Watched the 2021 version of Dune recently and I have to say I prefer Lynch's version
great actors, great stories, great SF, great text, great worms, great movie
Unfortunately, the film left me disoriented and unsatisfied. Along with great panaromas comes a story so difficuously told that it becomes an inexplicable mud puddle. On a planet that has no mud puddles.
Thought this was bad, but rewatched it after being massively disappointed in the 2021 version. It was much better than anticipated, and I feel this movie actually does the setting justice and properly explains who is who and what is going on. The characters and factions all get plenty of screentime and all have personality to them.
Music is great, scenery is epic and flavorful, dialogues are good for the most part. Special effects no longer hold up, but the entire movie just has soul and unlike the new movie, the characters and the writing actually checksSimply very good science fiction. A must see for me
Although the visuals were interesting, this is an excellent lesson of what can go wrong when you try to create too close an adaptation between two different mediums. The movie tried to copy the famous sci-fi book it's based on very closely, and this resulted in scenes that were oddly paced and dialogue that was unnatural. A movie is not a book and, and you need to make adjustments to make something work from one medium to the next. The writers and directors didn't bother to do this and the result was a slow, boring film with unnatural sounding characters
Corners are cut and a lot of background left out. This is to be expected with adapting such a huge story to a feature film. The tone of the narrative is extreme, bordering on melodrama, as can be expected from Lynch. This kind of treatment is not necessarily out of place because the story contains many themes that take things to the extreme, in particular genetic manipulation. The story suffers from the severe cutting, but comes out reasonably well, considering
Highly disappointed in this movie. There was absolutely no star wars in it. I thought this was set in Tatooine and was appalled to learn that that was not the case. The acting is not up to par. Would recommend that Tim Chalamet and Zendaya give attack of the clones a watch and draw inspiration from padme and annikan. No lightsabers, no clones, no r2d2, this is simply NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Do better.
Some of the models and effects were amazing. Some were much less impressive. The print was very dirty. Some of the chroma key looked really bad. Shame that the sound was not surround. Very original and creative use of effects but not the best example of this sci-fi fantasy type. They tried to pack too much story in. It should have been a trilogy of shorter movies. An interesting story but I had real trouble following it. I liked the old-school effects but failed to connect to the story. Some interesting ideas sadly don’t make up for plot confusion
While David Lynch's adaptation is not without admiration and ambition, it is ultimately only accessible to those already familiar with the source material. A fantastic cast is somewhat squandered with a lack of focus on character, while the pace of the film is all over the place with a slow, exposition heavy first half and a second half that races to get to the finish line. Though, special mention goes to Kenneth McMillan as the Baron, who steals every scene he's in
Lynch has a dead-on feel for the shivery intangibles that crawl under the skin and into the subconscious.
With The Elephant Man, Lynch asserts his unique brand of empathetic storytelling - one that always balances the light with the dark, the good with the evil.
Following his startling debut with Eraserhead, David Lynch retained that picture's industrial imagery, unnerving sound design, and oddball atmosphere and layered them over this rich story.
It's equal parts scary and sad - a Frankenstein's monster that can garner both fright and sympathy.
This is by far the most conventional of David Lynch's films, and thus perhaps it is the easiest with which to demonstrate his immense skill at narrative story-telling.
Flawless interpretation of the hit stage play about a Victorian Era gent living with a confronting physical affliction.
It is an absorbing and satisfying drama, and Hurt's Merrick is very powerful.
Director David Lynch does a great job, John Hurt is completely committed, and the mise-en-scène is excellent. [Full Review in Spanish]
Many Lynchian tropes are here, from a sense of foreboding to a fascination with the grotesque, in terms of Merrick and outsiders' reactions to him.
From deep beneath layers of latex makeup, Hurt inhabits a highly specific physical and behavioral characterization, while also conveying the essential, universal loneliness of the human soul.
As strange and modern as Lynch's vision is, The Elephant Man looks back to cinema's beginnings, with its images of locomotives and cinematic tricks that recall Georges Méliès.
The theme is something of a self-pitying clich, and yet Lynch takes such a novel path to it that the film has a hypnotic, transcendent force.
The Elephant Man is a perfect movie and, as John Hurt once said "If you're not moved by the time The Elephant Man is over...then you're not someone I want to know." I agree.
at its best when the story and period trappings serve Lynch's vision, and vice versa.
This is a tale of redemption and transcendence, of the hunchback of London Hospital, of the noble phantom who wanted to go to the opera, of Beauty and the Beast.
Lynch's powerful depiction of Merrick (played by John Hurt) moves a viewer from revulsion and fear to empathy and tenderness. That's the very movement of the story itself.
This stylish, poignant drama is probably the closest director David Lynch has got to the mainstream outside of the disastrous Dune.
Heartbreaking drama isn't for sensitive viewers.
The picture itself is a strange trade-off between Lynch's personal themes -- the night world of obscure, disturbing sexual obsessions -- and the requirements of a middlebrow message movie
The Elephant Man's success comes from John Hurt's powerful performance and Christopher Tucker's amazing makeup design. I'll admit that I wasn't really a fan of David Lynch's surrealist sequences, but I felt joy when people treated John Merrick with kindness, and I felt sorrow when others took advantage of him. No, it's not the true story of Joseph Merrick, but I feel like this film can inspire us all to be a little kinder to those who are different from us.
You have got to love the Elephant Man. There isn't one scene that doesn't move me. It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, "I am not an animal, I am a human being," I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1/10, what is wrong with you? This is an absolute masterpiece, without question! 10/10. Bethany Cox
This is incredibly human document. In few moments was so much dramatically talking. 8/10
A triumph in both its storytelling and its messaging. The filmmakers clearly cared about this character, which made it much easier to empathize with him. Easily one of the better films of the year of its release (1980).
incredibly sad & moving story - it's amazing how cruel people can be; equally amazing how much just a small amount of kindness can do. i have no doubt if this story was remade today the cruel parts would be MUCH worse than they were in this film, but they definitely achieve what they set out to do - it's well made & well acted.
Phenomenal acting and make up, a powerfully moving story, and an inspirational message make "The Elephant Man" one of the best movies to ever hit the big screen and one of the best movies ever made. Hopkins and Hurt stand out in this film, with Hurt giving an absolutely stellar performance as John Merrick himself. The entire film itself is depressing and can be hard to watch for certain people, especially those who have experienced similar situations, yet this movie does have a fantastic and uplifting message. The story, dialogue, and plot are unshaken and remain sturdy, and it uses the source material to its full potential. Overall, this is just a fantastic film that I would recommend that everyone watch at least once, though I can see why this film isn't for all.
The cruelty and the kindness of people. I'm not crying, you are.
Nobody can act better than John Hurt, he gave it his all and I think he won an academy award for this movie, I give it my highest rating short of perfect as 4 and 1/2 stars!!!!
This has to be the saddest movie I've ever seen. I was holding back more tears than I ever have for a movie. This is David Lynch's masterpiece no questions asked.
Tragic and heart-wrenching this movie gives modern audiences a look at how the disabled were treated not so long ago. You are sure to shed at least a single tear upon viewing the film. The film is very tender in some moments and extremely uncomfortable in others. A masterpiece of cinema by Lynch. To me the most beautiful aspects of the film are the moments in which we see John clinging to the promises of God that will be fulfilled for him in Heaven (and which are hinted at in the conclusion of the film).
A terrifying, the bottom-is-falling-out-from-beneath-us type of movie.
The king of midnight movies.
An unparalleled film of strange beauty, Eraserhead might be one of the most perfect demonstrations of the power of film as a medium and an artistic achievement.
Those black and white images stay with you; ingrained deeply in your soul.
A hallucinatory drama with impeccable technique and exemplary cinematography. [Full Review in Spanish]
German Expressionism meets grindhouse schlock, Eraserhead is a student film-turned-cult classic that probably would've been better as a 20-minute short.
In heaven, everything is fine but in Eraserhead nothing is fine. David Lynch's debut feature is grim, disturbed, mutated, claustrophobic, a world that appears to be unraveling-or, more accurately, decaying-before our eyes.
Linear plots with easily defined cause and effect are the kinds of stories we are used to, but sometimes it's refreshing to enter a world where logic takes a backseat to purely evocative storytelling.
It is the vision of the paranoid transposed upon the screen; the fact that it remains extremely interesting ought, I suppose, to be worrying. But perhaps our eyes have become so desensitised that nothing, any more, will widen the iris.
It's beautiful and strange, with its profoundly disturbing ambient sound design of industrial groaning, as if filmed inside some collapsing factory or gigantic dying organism.
What makes Eraserhead great -- and still, perhaps the best of all Lynch's films? Intensity. Nightmare clarity. And perhaps also it's the single-mindedness of its vision.
David Lynch never explains because he doesn't need to, his is the faith of the irrational, disconcertingly childlike in its illusionism.
A murkily pretentious shocker.
David Lynch's Eraserhead must stand as a pinnacle of screen surrealism to rival Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou.
You may never figure out the story or what it is meant to convey, but the lighting, effects, editing and directing are so dead on and beautifully executed that the visuals carry the piece over every question mark. In the end the questions beckon you back.
Some would say that Lynch has painted himself into a corner and the easiest way out is to layer on the hallucinations and lapse into catatonia rather than address the issues at hand. Others would say that Lynch reaches the heights of profundity and art.
a nightmarish spin down an industrial-wasteland rabbit hole that is equal parts surreal head-scratcher and emotionally driven horrorshow
Sculpted out of blocks of stark light amid pools of impenetrable darkness.
expertly crafted, wildly imaginative and deeply, deeply disturbing
The most terrifying film ever made.
David Lynch called his debut feature a "dream of dark and troubling things", and it certainly is that. Lynch is one of those directors that people seem to either love or hate - I'm firmly in the former camp. Sure, his movies are barely understandable, but I think they're meant to evoke nameless dreads more than they are meant to describe tangible stories. I don't know if Eraserhead means to say something distinct - people have speculated that it is about the fear of bearing a child but I'm not so sure. However, the nightmarish ambience and imagery of this movie will stay with me far longer than many perfectly comprehensible horror films.
I've seen probably thousands of movies at this point, many of them on the strange side, a select few that were outright bizarre. This one, hands down, is the undisputed champion of what the fuck did I just watch?! I don't even know how to describe what happened but it involves a lonely guy with Kramer hair, strange and random scenes of a smiling woman with chipmunk cheeks, and newborn baby General Ackbar(it's a trap!). Oh and a lot of whirring, screeching sounds throughout. I mean, this is David Lynch after all, so bizarre is to be expected. You'd think I would give this either a half star or no stars, but the way it was shot.. the fact that this was made in 1977.. and the fact I couldn't look away from it, I have to give it some credit at least. Yeah, if you want to see something truly out of the Twilight Zone, this is your movie.
What the flip garbage did I watch? I have been wanting to watch this movie for years now and I finally had the opportunity to watch this. And it's pure trash. Maybe it's because it's in black and white and I've never ever liked any black and white movie. Or it's because this movie makes no sense and it's only tolerable if you're high or intoxicated. I like the idea that the baby is like an alien and it's supposed to be a metaphor that babies are actual aliens to new parents at first because you don't know what to do with a baby at first. It takes time for the realization of oh wow I brought life into this world. But in this movie it didn't work for me. I also didn't really get it. Why in one scene the main characters head falls off and a a little kid takes it to an eraser factory and gets money for it. Like what was that? It's very confusing and some might argue to me saying "you don't get the movie." And they might be true but to me this is a convoluted mess of a movie. Very disappointing but the poster is iconic and cool. PS his crazy scientist hair cut is cool but besides that the rest of the movie was a huge let down.
I have never seen a more divided audience than those who have seen Eraserhead.  And though I can see both sides of the argument, and I truly respect David Lynch‘s artistic vision, I didn't find much enjoyment in the film.
There is a lot to admire about the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sound design is incredible, the makeup and animatronics are creative, and there is clearly a great amount of intelligence put into the story.
However, not only is the pacing agonizingly slow, not only did I not care about any of the characters, but it can also be argued that the film is too ambiguous; lacking humanity in favor of surrealism.
I understand why cinefiles have been divided on this film for decades, and I understand both sides of the argument. But, although I respect the imagination of the film, I can never see myself wanting to watch it again.
Randomness, surrealism, weirdness and ridiculousness, although potentially appealing, are ineffective in the case of "Eraserhead", which - neat practical effects, cool visuals and some fun ideas aside - emerges as a sluggish, boring, faux-disturbing collage of frames trapped in a bare-bones plot, and is nullified by a contradiction between disregard for cohesion, which renders it as good as meaningless, and insistence on some kind of storytelling, which robs it of its experimental potential.
I kind of wish I could erase Eraserhead from my mind. David Lynch uses some intriguing filmmaking techniques, but the barely-there story is senseless, the visuals are grotesquely gratuitous, and the pretentious pace is mind-numbingly slow. I can't help but think how awkward filming must have been for the actors. This surrealist student film doesn't make the grade.
Of a very divisive director, along with Mulholland Drive Eraserhead is one of his most polarising films, with people finding it wonderfully surreal, funny and unsettling and others will find it for their tastes confusing, too out there and weird. On first viewing the latter was the case with me(after being so amazed by the accessible emotional power that The Elephant Man and The Straight Story gave) but after further viewings(Lynch is one of those directors where each of his films should be seen more than once) now it's the former. While Eraserhead is not quite among Lynch's best films(Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story) it is still a very good, even great debut from him, albeit with some parts that are a bit too draggy and drawn out. Eraserhead looks splendid, it's beautifully shot and coupled with the film-noir-ish lighting it's a highly atmospheric-looking film. It's not a Lynch film without surreal imagery and Eraserhead is filled with that and in a way that even early in his career is very distinctive of Lynch. The score has an eerie tension and used in an understated way, not one of the best film scores out there but it suits the film well. The dialogue is spare, only about 21 minutes worth and while not exceptional it is a long way from poor, though maybe Eraserhead may have fared even better without it(big emphasis on maybe). Lynch's direction is for a debut very accomplished if not at his best, his direction in the likes of Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive was pretty much masterly. The story is distinctively surreal and oddball but also very expertly unnerving, Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man feel more accessible but Eraserhead is essentially a mood piece and works amazingly as one. The theme of a man fearing fatherhood will resonate with a lot of viewers too. The mutant baby is incredibly creepy but there is room for some funny moments in a very low-key way especially the dinner-table scene. The acting is great, especially from lead actor Jack Nance, what was most effective about his acting was how personal it felt, in fact the whole film felt very personal. Overall, will divide viewers, it did bewilder me at first, Eraserhead proves to be a very, very good debut as well as a very, very good film where no matter how you feel about the film you cannot deny that a lot of effort had been put into making it. 9/10 Bethany Cox
Eraserhead is my introduction to David Lynch and I'm sad to say that I was thoroughly disappointed. Make sure to read through the end because I start with the pros then I explain why it didn't hit me.
The craziest thing to me is that we go over 5 minutes into it and all we've seen is a sideways man and a different man sitting at a window, with long drawn out camera shots and no dialogue. It's beautiful. I'm surprised to say that I really believe it's beautiful while being so simple. In my opinion, making a black and white movie look really pretty is hard… yet Lynch makes it seem easy. These shots are seriously breathtaking and I'm so blown away by that. I haven't seen many B&W films but jeez this has really raised my expectations of them. I mean guys these shots are actually amazing. Maybe I'm biased because I shoot film and so I thoroughly enjoy seeing buildings and staircases and people off center but it's just so magnificent and it really grabbed my attention.
The audio is wild. Not a good or a bad wild though… it's a lot of ambient noise except it's an extremely intense white noise. I like the way it fades in and out and how sometimes music will come in… very notable aspect that added a lot to my mental state while watching.
To be honest, I was completely lost on this storyline. I wanted so badly to follow it closely and be attached the entire way through, but it was just a little too bland for me I believe. A slow story filled with strange dialogue and confusing interactions. Truly the only serious flaw in this entire movie is the fact that the plot is so confusing. Maybe I'm not artsy enough to understand or something but shoot dude I was really rooting for this one. Like ayo, aliens??? Nah bro. 
There are quite a lot of pros to Eraserhead but sadly the cons outweigh the pros. I tried my best to like it but it just wasn't for me.
A series of images giving form to our fears about ourselves. It is one thing to feel threatened from the outside, quite another to feel life has dealt you tortures you didn't ask for
Combining animation and live action this short film conveys the sense of fear of learning - in David Lynch's own idiosyncratic kind of way.
Not sure what attracted me to this film, which is really nothing more than, as David Lynch puts it on the DVD, an interpretation of someone else's dream through his own state of mind. But I really, really felt immersed in what Lynch was doing visually with the film. Obviously, it doesn't make a lick of sense if you're looking for it, but I loved the mixture of different elements within the medium. There's actual film shot of Lynch's wife Peggy going rather bonkers while in a bed. Then this is mixed around with animation treated on-TOP of the filmed footage. Then there is other mixed media, such as a filmed animated spot shook around with other pieces of color and light. There's even a quick shot of black falling down upon white, if that makes sense (which it doesn't). I was told by some others that this one was the weakest of the Lynch shorts, but that goes without saying that each one of his early works will divide viewers like in any good old art-school class. If one knows though the lengths to which the filmmaker is ready to portray his audio-visual interpretations on screen one might appreciate it a little more if they just happen to stumble upon it. On a personal level it's one of the best student works I've seen from the period of a promising talent.
very abstract very short
Trippy, haunting, and often odd, The Alphabet is a short film made by David Lynch early in his career. It's based upon a nightmare that a child he knew at the time had, making this a very abstract piece. I found it particularly affecting and memorable, even though it really has no concrete point to it. It's pure expressionism from David Lynch, and that is far more interesting than many films of its ilk.
A very short work at under 4 minutes, depicts the aphabet via a lucid and disturbing nightmare, which apparently is where Lynch derived it from.  It is very experimental and nothing I would say is esential viewing, but still very interesting to watch along with his other early shorts.
Moving on from his first foray into film, David Lynch created this animation and live action hybrid short, which is genuinely creepy and unsettling, with weird distorted baby sounds and kids saying the ABCs and some woman spewing blood. Lynch is a nut, but nut I truly respect.
Altogether, David Lynch, for his debut into the film industry, has handcrafted a cryptic motion picture that exudes a sinister tone. Few may see this type of tone as an immediate dismissal; many will undeniably commend Lynch's execution for his stylish, yet strangely intricate vision.
Experimental films are always difficult to review. It's often difficult to predetermine whether one should jump into an experimental film to be entertained, moved, persuaded, or enthralled by mesmerizing visuals. Regardless, "The Alphabet"'s a near 4 minute long short film takes every sense of the word "unconventional" to its full advantage and confidently fulfills its goal. 
From the opening second to the closing fade, "The Alphabet" illustrates, what may seem to be at first, an inscrutable narrative, but there is, undeniably, a profound message David Lynch seeks to show the audience. Chanting of the simple ABC's, ink-blotted stop-motion pictures that are psychotically etched in, and blood -- in a disturbing craze -- pouring out, is what "The Alphabet" is furnished with. As one can imagine, this short consistently evokes a pitch-dark tone and eerily disturbing imagery, enough to erode the mind. And surprisingly for a film that has little to no narrative, it's fast-paced and always drawing up new frightening images with a focused objective in mind. Agreeably, "The Alphabet" takes full advantage of shock-value, but uses each frame effectively to portray a message of what may be a dull subject through other mediums. "The Alphabet" encourages the keen to handpick and spot the symbolism and meaning behind its dark exterior. In other words, this is an immersive piece of filmmaking that is sure to initiate conversations longer than the actual film's running time.
Altogether, David Lynch, for his debut into the film industry, has handcrafted a cryptic motion picture that exudes a sinister tone. Few may see this type of tone as an immediate dismissal; many will undeniably commend Lynch's execution for his stylish, yet strangely intricate vision.
Nothing special about this three minute experimental short. Nothing meaningful is going on as far as I can tell and it is just a selection of moving images Lynch has assembled to create a particular mood or tone but I was very glad it was only three minutes and it didn't have a huge effect on me.
Not a bad experimental short films from David Lynch as far as experimental short films go. I thought it was rather original and simple, eyebrow raising early stuff from the famous director. Not at all a waste of a few measly minutes out of your life, if anything, it will be worth it.
Any single second of this film's cinematography is immediately recognizable as the work of the creative mind of David Lynch.
However, it is like watching a nightmare:  odd, disturbing, pointless.  It is ostensibly about an abused child who grows a grandmother so he can have a comforting
presence in his dysfunctional family.  The entire 33 minutes is an exercise in visual and aural ugliness.  Everyone is in white makeup; the boy is formally dressed resembling Emcee in Cabaret.  When the family sits down to eat, plastic bags of bread are strewn on the table, an unlit electric lamp takes up most of the tablespace (candles may have looked too pretty).  Any furniture visible in the stark high contrast cinematography is thrift-store trash. 
Although it has sound, it is mostly atonal noise and shrieks. Although it is a live-action film, there is animation (more ugliness); although it is in black and white, there are colors, the most pronounced being dark yellow urine stains. (This poor kid must need a urologist.)  Urine in this movie is about as profuse as blood is in The Shining.  
The grandmother who grows quickly out of a bulb, smiles sometimes, but since that is about it for her as a contrast to the shouting monosyllabic parents, she isn't that much of a comfort.  She mostly lies in her bed of dirt--but isn't that the same bed the boy wets all the time?  Oh, well, dreams don't have to make sense.
The surreal look is peppered with stop-motion cinematography, so Lynchian.  But it is only "enjoyable" as an example of his style.   This is to be seen by film-students, not audiences seeking escapism.  The reaction is meant to be less "Hooray for Hollywood" and more "WTF!"
Amazing minutes of film. utterly disturbing, like Lynch has managed to film someones bad dream
Told without dialogue, but with an elaborate soundtrack, combining animation and staged scenes, this David Lynch short tells a surreal story, many moments suggesting his later feature Eraserhead.
When setting my DVR for the week and seeing what was playing on TCM Underground, the description for this film, that a boy plants a seed to grow a grandmother, sounded so bizarre I HAD to record it. Watching the film, it's was even stranger than I expected, with a wordless story (the characters do grunt and vocalize), where all the characters in white face paint, filmed on sparsely decorated sets against a black background, and set to an unsettling score made up of what seems to be industrial noises (by a band named Tractor). While watching "The Grandmother," my impression was this seems like a bad version of "Eraserhead," but when the credits rolled I saw that this was in fact written and directed by David Lynch! This short film predates "Eraserhead" and if very amateurish in comparison. I'm a huge David Lynch fan, but "The Grandmother" felt more like a pretentious film major final project than a polished piece of filmmaking, instead brimming with self important, heavy-handed symbolism, amateurish acting, and poor photography. However, even in this primitive state, the visuals are unmistakably Lynchian, filling mundane settings with the surreal, a penchant for the grotesque (the boy stroking the growing grandmother is quite off-putting), and a very precise color palette. You can also sense Lynch's dark humor, although, like many of his earlier films, it's purposefully challenging and hard to watch. So to be sure, this is probably the worst David Lynch film I'd seen (until I watched "The Amputee" right after), but it's still interesting, if at the same time is annoyingly self important.
pointless. Don't waste your time
WTF That is all I have to say.
This is my favorite of David Lynch's short films. Escapism is conveyed in such a serene way here, it's an easy short to get lost in. With a unique visual style reminiscent of Eraserhead, it can be read as a prequel, as both works feature protagonists who indulge themselves in fantastical lust as an escape from the dissonance they feel with their real-life struggles. Is the boy in this short a young Henry Spencer? Perhaps so.
One of David Lynch's more famous short films "The Grandmother" is a silent film about a boy who is horribly abused by his odd parents, once he sprouts out of the ground next to them during the beginning of the film, presumably signifying him to have been an unplanned pregnancy. The parents only seem to communicate with him through moronic shouts, and random bursts of physical abuse. One day after a day filled with torment, He finds a bag of seeds upstairs, one of these seeds contains the boys grandmother, he plants the seed, helps water it and grow it until his grandmother emerges from the plant. the boy and the grandmother form a bond, and the film gets stranger from there. 
This definitely screams Lynch and is known as the work that helped lead to his much more accomplished film Eraserhead. While never really hitting the mark, however you can definitely see the signs of what would become one of the worlds most distinctive directors in Cinema. Lynch uses the colors of white and red well here against the entirely black backdrop, with purposefully choppy visuals, mixed in with crudely drawn animation that bleeds with symbolism, and eerie sound design to create something occasionally unsettling, but never at all clear enough to be truly thought provoking.
Before directing his breakthrough cult classic 'Eraserhead' David Lynch made this thirty-minute art school oddity, sketching on a smaller canvas the same nightmares that would later haunt his feature films. Using a raw, experimental style combining exaggerated live action with naive animation, Lynch flaunts his preoccupation with psychosexual imagery and symbolism, showing all the creative freedom (and many of the pretensions) of an artist discovering his true medium. Yes, the film does have a plot, but it's not really about a boy and his grandmother, any more than 'Eraserhead' was about a man and his baby. Shown on the same program (when I saw it, at the Red Vic Theatre on Haight Street in San Francisco) was the eight-minute animated 'Alphabet', another early Lynch project, and definitely not the sort of pre-school primer taught on Sesame Street. Viewers familiar with his more recent work will know exactly what to expect.
If anyone has anyone has seen David Lynch's Eraserhead and would like to see a fertile mind craft something similar but in a far more abstract manner then The Grandmother is your answer. I didn't think I'd find this as memorable as it ended up being, but it's certainly effective at its ability to disturb and fascinate you. Less focused on story and more about images and feelings, it will certainly give you something to remember.
As if Bogart himself rose from the dead, got hammered, and dictated his heartfelt last will and testament in cinema-speak to a no-nonsense bartender just before closing time.
Shot in a scratchy black-and-white reminiscent of the 1940s film noir, the bizarre idea of featuring a suspect in the form of a talking capuchin monkey is pure David Lynch.
Classic David Lynch and a must-see for all Lynch lovers. From now on every movie must feature a monkey singing a love song to a chicken.
Beneath the absurdity and non-sequiturs there's an emotional weight to the elliptical back story, and the monkey's wonderfully expressive face -- guilty, agitated, rueful -- suits the piece perfectly.
It's simply an excursion of style, one which deserves as many logical rematches as your brain can handle.
It's an oddly welcoming return for David Lynch and, in its short runtime, it gives audiences a unique spin on the Interrogation scene that has become so well known in the film industry.
It's weird as hell, man, and I can't get enough of it.
If you are a David Lynch fan you absolutely need to go see What Did Jack Do.
No more than an exercise in style -- but what distinctive style.
David Lynch's sense of humor has become slightly more acerbic -- his sense of whimsy has only increased over the years -- so What Did Jack Do? plays partly like a silly prank on Netflix subscribers. This is a great thing.
While short in length, What Did Jack Do? has plenty of time to show off Lynch's supreme talent for surreal storytelling (and acting).
It is comedy. It is drama. It is most definitely noir, rich with delicious Lynchisms, from the squashed-flat line readings to the weird Vaudevillian flourishes to THE COFFEE. But Jack's greatest Lynchian allure is its musty atmosphere.
It is all very silly. It will be embraced as a puckish masterwork from a beloved cultural figure. And sure, what the hell, why not. Look, I don't know what to tell you.
Lynch manages to create something singular to his own world. And as ever, it feels to the viewer that we have only been gifted a fragment of a larger, unseen text where everything, one day, might fall into place and make sense.
This movie cured my cancer
David Lynch mixes his earlier "Eraserhead" work with a much sillier "Wolf Among Us"-type plotline/character list that works not only as a hilarious and engaging short film, but also, like his others, intriguing to dig into and leaving you desperate to see more of it. 9/10
Weird doesn't mean bad folks.
A wonderful short from the master. Lynch's sense of humor is on point as ever.
what did jack do what did jack do what did ja
Although it seems silly, the absurdism and the atmosphere make it a visibly beautiful and well-constructed work.
If you watched this, like I did, then we've been punk'd.
Cringe Netflix short film by David Lynch. Very peculiar.
Its premise is quite odd, but this black-and-white noir short is strongly complemented by David Lynch's surreal style.
Lynch is referencing that most all-American of televisual genres, the sit-com, to show not only his nation's nightmarish underside of drooling, pugnacious idiocy, but also perhaps his own.
It makes you wonder if Lynch doesn't occasionally abuse the benefit of the doubt
Gets saved by the last part, which is the most hilarious of the whole collection. In general however, the deliberately sloppy animation and nonsensical story lines don't work as well as Lynch seems to think - but that's okay, because everyone including Lynch will acknowledge it's the complete opposite of his 'magnum opus'.
Dumbland is not for all. In fact Dumbland maybe in for nobody except Lynch and that's what make it funny and a collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Profanity? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans that don't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun. From México I can say I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeths are bleeding, all the noise around and violence make me wanna scream and put me behind my bed. 2- Get the stick! Yeah baby get it and learn a lesson: some people never be thankful for your actions. 3- Ants. The more Lynch episode of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge...
I love David Lynch with a passion but I have no idea what the fuck this was haha
This is a mixed review from me. First off, the animation is supposed to be crude and terrible, as is the actual production value of the overall collection. But secondly, its so stupid it doesn't even really warrant a viewing unless you are a diehard fan of Lynch-related things. Having said that, of course much of this DVD is funny (the ant episode near the end in particular) and the amount of swearing and intensity of Lynch's own voice work is particularly amusing. Something, like his short film collection, to get high to, for sure.
Je ne peux pas croire que ce ramassis de cochonnerie soit vraiment du Lynch. Une critique de la société américaine? Pfff.
Funny, hard to watch, intentionally horrible. David Lynch can do no wrong.
Not even remotely accessible, this scathingly humorous and often quite unsettling set of very short tales of suburban childhood is littered with domestic violence, bullish stereotypes and classic sit-com moments twisted and transmogrified to reflect the dark nightmare of inbred American suburban existence. In an interesting juxtaposition, the broad infantile nature of some of the comedy is a little idiotic and while it might neatly reflect several less pleasant elements of mainstream taste - it also serves to paint this usually ambiguous and effective work with a brush of unpleasant over-indulgence. Admittedly not an unfamiliar notion when considering Lynch's back catalogue - but its certainly witnessed in a more obvious fashion here. 
For die-hard fans of Lynch (which presumably includes Lynch himself) only.
So incredibly weird, but honestly it's one of the funniest cartoons i've ever seen. In all of the episodes there is something to love. The dad manages to be funny non-stop. Whether it is dialogue or actions, I just couldn't help but crack up. This is so filthy, but completely intentional. It does what things like King of the Hill and Beavis and Butthead wish they could do, truly represent the horrible side of human life.
I got to watch Dumbland the other night, and I was really pleased to see something completely new from David Lynch. I've heard his movies described as "art films with a... plot?" and I have to admit that I'm not a hardcore Lynch fan myself. But, with this work it seems like he finally gets to portray something completely on his own terms and without pressure to stay in his own style. Dumbland made me laugh alot, I'm not going to lie. It was very very funny to me. It is completely absurd and obtusely blatant in Lynch's opinions, and is in contrast to the subtleties of his feature films, and this may be why I liked it in comparision. That, and the brevity of each episode. But really, this family and the father in particular being portrayed, is every where I look, and now when I see children bugging the hell out of their parents at the mall, I just pretend they're saying "My teeth are bleeding!" and feel closer to Lynch in our communal detachment from society.
okay where to start, well hmmm this'll start it off great, David Lynch is completely fucked in the head, but that is where his amazing brilliance came up with such amazing movies like Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr. & Eraserhead. well in many ways, this is extremely hilarious (well to those with a screwed up sense of humor) i.e. "me". but you can find Dumbland on youtube or buy it on amazon, so definatley check this one out if your in the mood to laugh
a sense of something presented merely in embryo, but full of suggestion and possibility, marks most of the material in this collection... no fan of Lynch will be able to resist peering into this box of half-formed ideas.
Probably where a lot of people draw the line when it comes to Lynch coming up with wacky weird stuff just for the sake of it. I am a Lynch fan so I enjoyed it up to a certain degree but stuff like this isn't nearly as good as his experimental shorts that were in that one set of his.
This features seven David Lynch short films from his website along with introductions. Personally I liked Darkened Hour, Boat and Lamp. The other films weren't quite my thing, but it is interesting hearing Lynch telling about his projects. 
After the films, David Lynch answers questions sent to the webpage. Also this is very interesting to watch.
The Straight Story is a small motion-picture miracle. How could a film whose high points include a man tasting his first beer in three decades be anything else?
This is the act of forgiveness given the proper cinematic and moral weight it deserves, following one man across the country on a lawnmower as he tries to make amends. You will cry your face off.
Lovely little film with a sweet and subtle lead performance you won't soon forget
It's intriguing to watch the Lynch of Blue Velvet and Lost Highway feel his way toward a less wounding surrealism -- into images that have power to hurt and will do none.
It's unlike anything else in Lynch's filmography, and it's genuinely brilliant.
It seems only fitting that Lynch's most unambiguous, sentimental film should concern a man named Straight and the title is entirely apposite.
It's hard to imagine a gentler film, yet Lynch fully exploits the stately pace to gaze fondly upon life's rich pageant.
Instead, like Alvin, [Lynch's] film sets out on its mission in its own unassuming way and; inviting as those campfire flames around which so many stories have been told.
David Lynch's movie - the finest he has made since "Blue Velvet" - is serenely bereft of postmodern cynicism.
With his sweet, lyrical masterpiece... David Lynch frees himself from the heavy irony and noir affectations of his last few films, discovering the pure, mythical slice of Americana previously confined to Agent Cooper's coffee and donuts in Twin Peaks.
As far as I can see, [David Lynch] simply spotted a great story and embraced it. So will you.
The Straight Story could easily slide into melancholy and sentimentality without Lynch's sensibility, an odd mix of up-by-your bootstraps American conservatism and on-the-road romanticism.
Is The Straight Story one of my favorite Lynch films? Hard to say. Is it one of his most meticulously, and perfectly constructed? Well, I just can't disagree on that one.
look and feel of a foreign film
Great, but young kids may be bored and restless.
Mainstream-accessible yet completely maintains Lynch's uniquely off-kilter artistic identity.
One could say that The Straight Story is a twilight Western on the order of Unforgiven, except that the pale rider here mounts a snail-paced John Deere instead of a stallion.
Coming straight from his Eagle Scout's heart, "The Straight Story" is David Lynch's simplest, most straightforward and most mature film to date.
Farnsworth's easy, twinkle eyed charm is a winner all the way, but it's finally the film's deceptive simplicity and unabashed warmth that make it one of Lynch's most artistically and emotionally satisfying movies.
Unlike anything else that David Lynch has directed, The Straight Story tells the tale of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), an ailing senior citizen who travels almost three-hundred miles on a lawn mower to visit his estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton), the recent victim of a stroke.  It is a film filled with striking, meaningful images, sparse but meaningful dialogue (‘the worst part of being old is remembering when you was young.'), a heartbreaking performance from Farnsworth (especially in light of his condition at the time of filming), a touching soundtrack, and countless memorable scenes, sentimental without ever becoming maudlin. that continue to resonate long after the film is over.
There's something endearing about the simplicity of The Straight Story. This movie is like driving on the open road. During the more boring parts, you can just sit back and enjoy the scenery. Richard Farnsworth plays his role well. Even though his quest makes you want to shake your head, you like Alvin and cheer him on as he goes. It's still strange to me that David Lynch made a G-rated Disney movie, but I certainly enjoyed the journey.
A leisurely odyssey about an elderly man's determination to make amends with his brother. This is a 'journey' film through and through, and one of Lynch's only "normal", non-surreal projects. Alvin Straight is a great character full of wisdom that makes viewers self-reflect.
The plot may be slow and simple like the riding mower at its center, but with realistic writing, committed performances and beautiful cinematography, this true and bizarre road trip movie has a lot to offer in the realm of calm, meditative storytelling - a rarity for a Disney film; let alone an independent Disney-acquired film.
I like David Lynch and his movies, my favourites being The Elephant Man, Mulholland Dr, Blue Velvet and this. I don't think I can add very much to the previous reviews that sum it up so nicely, but I'll do my best. The Straight Story is not a complex movie, the script is quite simple but it didn't need to be. Despite its simplicity, the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it. The film is also quite meditative in its pace, but again that didn't bother me at all, because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate. Besides, even if they were flaws, which I don't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to The Straight Story, the film has a number of things to love about it. For one thing, the Straight Story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding. The score adds to the film's poignant tones, in terms of direction The Straight Story is one of Lynch's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too. Also Richard Farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance, he genuinely moved me and I felt for his character too. In conclusion, a beautiful film and one of Lynch's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox
A journey about getting somewhere on your own terms. On your own time. At the point in life, where you've got not much time left and yet nothing to really spend the rest of it on. Simple but poignant conversations, back to back, that Alvin has with people he meets on his journey are the majority of screen time in this film. The authenticity of it all and how well it's captured, make something, that should be considerably underwhelming feel engaging. All thanks to great direction, sublime soundtrack and eccentricity of the side characters film introduces and some of the underbellies of the dialogue and mannerisms of Alvin. And of course, that ending that makes it all worth it.
This is not the Lynch you'd expect, yet you get a wonderful crafted movie. You can see here how Lynch masters the narration, timings, photography, emotions, cinema.
Based on a true story of a septuagenarian, Alvin Straight, who crosses Iowa to get to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother on a lawn mower. This movie starts a little slow, then picks up a little once Alvin gets on the road. The movie takes its time to allow the audience to breathe and digest the dialogue and what is happening on screen. There are a lot of scenes that have long moments of just silence as two characters just share the moment and I found that I enjoyed that, to a point. Being from Iowa and Wisconsin, I appreciated the on location filming and a few Iowa references. This film has a lot of heart, made even more special knowing that it is based on real events. Definitely worth a watch!
A movie about a stubborn man, brotherly love, confronting death, confronting age, and the strength and importance of family bond. The movie, like the protagonist, moves slowly and determinedly, saying a lot with few words. The title of the movie is more than enough description and as far as adhering to that, it could have done worse.
Very interesting part of Lynch's oeuvre, as it's the only film he directed that he didn't write. While it's more 'normal' than most of his other films, what I love about this is it's still unmistakably his. It's still weird, after all, a guy driving such a distance on a lawnmower is totally something David Lynch would make a movie about! It also manages to have incredible emotional depth while avoiding sentimentality. Fantastic acting as well.
Absolutely loved this quirky and heartwarming story that, while differing from many of David Lynch's films with the straight forward narrative employed, was also still immediately recognizable as his work. Aside from the excellent job by Farnsworth as the lead, the cast of side characters offered some of the funniest and most pleasantly enjoyable moments in their interactions with him. I laughed out loud at least twice in the first twenty minutes and was soaking up every one of the exchanges between these colorful characters. I wasn't too sure about Spacek's character but when more of her background was filled in it was easier to understand certain aspects of her performance that I had previously found no purpose in. The Badalamenti score also added even more value to this film than usual and he felt completely in sync with the mood and tone of the film that at times it could seem like the cinematic scenes were written after the accompanying score. I had always been told this film was nothing like David Lynch's other work and being a Disney film, found that easy to believe. I guess the mistake I made was always taking this as a criticism, when I now know it clearly wasn't. I found a more digestible Lynch just as emotionally and intellectually stimulating, albeit in a slightly different manner.
One of those peaceful Sunday afternoon dramas that say so much without saying a lot.
Slow but steady tale causing you to reflect on getting older and wanting to make things right. Worth watching as long as you adjust your expectations.
A beautiful movie and easily one of Lynch's best. I feel obliged to push back on the notion that this movie is somehow at odds with his filmography because of the G rating. This is a gentler Lynch to be sure but the movie is still his through and through both narratively and stylistically.
It diverts from the usual criteria of a lynch film minus the gripping cinematography, but overall, this road trip is boring and for old folks only.
This is three episode mini-series created by David Lynch (he directed two of the episodes). As a David Lynch tv-series following Twin Peaks, I'd say that this is not all that convincing, but, on the other hand, it isn't bad either.
Accepting Wild at Heart as a flame-fueled story in a Lynchian technique helps to not only concur with the film's harshest critics, but also celebrate the very qualities they condemn.
I have a hard time focusing during Lynch's films, but so many of Wild at Heart's extreme scenes stick with me.
I enjoyed it more back in 1990, though I'd be hard-pressed to recall exactly why -- viewing it now, it's only a marginally satisfying experience, with some potent set-pieces diluted by an almost juvenile predilection on Lynch's part.
There is no denying the fun to be had with Wild at Heart. Its irresistibly charismatic leads draw you into Lynch's anything goes, 50s-inflected nightmare with an ease and insanity that's unlike anything put to film before or after.
I don't think at all that 'Wild Heart' is one of the great works of David Lynch, but I must say it is a wildly entertaining road movie about love, passion and freedom. [Full review in Spanish]
Most of the time it's unquestionably disturbing, but every so often a hint of deeper meaning pokes through the strangeness.
A non-stop fun-fest that doesn't have tried to be groovy, but goes to great pains to make sure things stay that way.
Perhaps the major problem is that despite Cage and Dern's best efforts, Lynch is ultimately interested only in iconography, not characters at all.
The scattergun nastiness is, after a while, profoundly unaffecting.
Lynch brings forth a world where evil and weirdness coexist, the two being these obstacles that arise in the way of a romance unlike any other.
There's a spontaneous, anything-can-happen feeling to it that's the primary appeal of any road movie.
A perverse, violent, nutso depiction of romance that even Bonnie and Clyde would shrug off as too hardcore for them.
Should be perceived as a wicked comedy.
The result's mostly empty at heart and hollow on top.
Even the title is a letdown, somehow.
Joltingly violent, wickedly funny and rivetingly erotic.
It's not a pleasant film by any definition, and it's not remotely for everyone, but it's true to Lynch's vision.
Lynch's paean to Wizard of Oz divided critics when it premeiered at Cannes, and it never found an audience beyond the helmer's fans who enjoyed the fable's couple (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) taking their own Yellow Brick Road in search of the wizard
David Lynch walked Willem Dafoe on down to the wardrobe department, and just told them: "Make this man look like a gross John Waters". 
Wild at Heart is very 'David Lynch' - wandering and immersed in puzzling tone/character design, but strange to the point of endearment. As a filmmaker, it seems that Lynch has a particular talent for creating a range of distinctive, memorable, and unique characters, but also revels in dense ambiguity when it comes to theme and plot; this combination gives him the appearance of an appealing and interesting artist, but it's a bit of a cop-out, leaving your films so wide open to interpretation that they are essentially meaningless. In certain contexts, like the mental instability of Mulholland Dr., this structure makes sense and plays well into the design of the film. But in Wild at Heart, there is just as much confusion as there is entertainment value for what is essentially a traditional road movie at its core. It's not like every film needs to be completely objective and literal, but Wild at Heart is a good representation of Lynch's tendency to drop bizarre breadcrumbs which people eat up and furiously defend as divinely inspired.
For the many, many scenarios where it will be relevant in the future: Eisenhower Dollars are not silver dollars. They look like them, but have no silver content. This has been 'Pedantic Coin-Based Movie Trivia'. (3/5)
This movie is honestly crazy. This is the type of movie you show to someone who has never seen a movie, so they never want to watch another. I'm not sure how many Wizard of Oz references were made, but all I'll say is.. to many. Willem Dafoe as Bobby Peru was pure gold. Some of his scenes will haunt me for life. I think I've changed as a person after seeing this. I'm inspired.
Wild at Heart is not David Lynch at his best, personally much prefer Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story and is definitely not going to be everybody's cup of tea. But while it has its flaws Wild at Heart still impresses and fascinates in many ways, also don't think that it's his worst like some people I know in the past have said(that'd be Dune). The story does feel very randomly structured at times, especially true with Crispin Glover, and some of the pacing slackens; the film could have done with being shorter as some scenes did feel too padded and underdeveloped, and the script can be a confused jumble and not always easy to understand completely(though admittedly there are some quotable lines). There are many great things with Wild at Heart however because the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is bursting with vivid colour and there are plenty of bold colours and lighting with some of the visuals being wonderfully deranged. There is also a hypnotic soundtrack that adds so much to the feel of the film, the music choices being also quite interesting, while Lynch's direction while not the best he's ever done(tied between Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive) but it is very adept and has his unique style all over. The story is not the best but the atmosphere is just great, just loved the campiness, the eroticism and haunting weirdness, it's hardly uneventful and there are some memorable moments like the incredibly chilling robbery sequence and the ending. The Wizard of Oz references while a little over-used are fun. The characters are not likable at all, in fact in the cases of Marietta and Bobby a few of them could be seen as loathsome, but considering the atmosphere and viciously violent but also sexy content of the film it is clear that they weren't intended to be. The performances are fine, Nicholas Cage will induce polarising opinions but while he was wooden to start with he was charming and entertaining once he warmed up. Laura Dern is alluring with the two working comfortably together, while Diana Ladd manages to be both hilarious and scary and Willem Dafoe is unforgettably creepy. The cameos acquit themselves well too. All in all, incredibly strange and not without flaws but also fascinating. 7/10 Bethany Cox
I guess this is generally seen as one of Lynch's lesser works but personally found this to be a thoroughly brilliant piece of work. Made around the same time as the first 2 series of Twin Peaks, it has the same combination of comic weirdness, soap opera melodrama, and terrifying violence but less of the "haunting" feeling of latter-day Lynch. Reads to me as a chronicle of the sordidness and emptiness at the heart of America, whilst still being very much of that country in terms of aesthetics and style. The only thing which I disliked was the film's sexual politics, the repeated sex scenes with Laura Dern felt somewhat unnecessary; the unpleasant scene with Dern and Willem Dafoe also felt off in the context of a film with so much of the male gaze.
Come on, it's easy to dismiss this movie as trashy, but follow Lynch along in his extravaganza and you'll have a good time. Visually speaking it's very stimulating, swinging from crazy violence to turbid eroticism. The soundtrack is marvelous too, and is deeply influenced by one of the two drivers of the movie, which is Elvis. The other driver is Oz, interpreted in an original way.
This movie was shot during the Twin Peaks days, and it is clear because of the actors (brace yourselves 'till the end for crazy cameos) and the mood...at times it feels like Twin Peaks in the South.
one huge cliche of a film featuring a guy with terrible tooth decay. what even was this film... pilot is a character who just "has it all", he has this good guy image with an extremely opposite other side, the first few seconds of the film was very unexpected which i very much enjoyed, but the further the film went on the more ridiculous it got... the terribly edited harpy wailing in the bar when he sings... the unecessary car crash scene which had nothing to do with anything, it kind of just "happened"... let's not forget the part where he just decides to walk away from his lover and kid THE DAY HE MET HIM, then gets randomly punched for no reason at all by some gang who just stare at him while he's passed out, has a vision of some fairy in a wallmart costume, wakes up and appologises to the thugs for calling them a bunch of f@gs and then terribly sings love me tender to his girl while standing on top of a car after just leaving her a few minutes earlier...
this movie was made for mentally disfunctional boomers, a true late 80s to early 90s absolute crapfest. also what was with the mum? what an egghead. it's worth a watch once because it's simply so bad and a good laugh, make sure you drink though, no one can watch this sober,crazy this got 81% audience score, people must be drinking windex
I love this movie, though maybe not quite as much as a number of Lynch's other films. What's different about this one is that it's really a black comedy road movie. That's not to say it's without serious moments. It's one of Lynch's most violent movies and there are a couple of scenes here which are genuinely disturbing. Overall though, it shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's incredibly entertaining. Like Blue Velvet, it's very strange with much imagery typical of Lynch but has a plot that is easy to follow. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are fantastic, but the best performance would have to be from Willem Dafoe, unforgettable as Bobby Peru, one of the most underrated movie villains ever.
Eat you heart out, 'True Romance'.
The idea of Cage and Lynch working together seems pretty natural when I think about it and I am not sure what has taken me so long to indulge, the results of which begin to pay off about thirty seconds into this hilariously macabre story.
Dern and Cage lead what is an amazing ensemble cast highlighted for me in the performances of Harry Dean Stanton and Willem Dafoe. 7.5/10
Compared to what I've come to expect from Lynch, it's pretty garbage. Cage, Dern, and DaFoe are great but the excessive side characters and lack of a cohesive plot really drags this one down for me. The pieces are there and there were a few really fun moments but it never came together
A frustrating, disjointed, sophomoric picture...There is some intriguing madness here and there, but this is still one of Lynch's worst offerings to date
Another Lynch film with crazy visuals, hidden meanings and off the wall characters and scenes that have symbolism thrown in there somewhere. The films over-the-top and bloody beginning doesn't match the rest of the film around it. I like to describe Wild At Heart as a firework, it goes up quickly, has that brief pause and the explodes with all it's fiery wonder. Unfortunately that brief pause is elongated for about 40 minutes. It's nothing terrible, but I found myself drifting in and out with it. The film is just out there... Like any other Lynchian wonder. The film looked impressive had some amazing Elvis covers that I'm sure Nicolas Cage loved singing. It's unique... I'll give it that.
A surreal lovers-on-the-run tale from the reliably strange David Lynch, 'Wild at Heart' is a bizarre and utterly captivating film that manages to strike the perfect balance between weird and wonderful.
This movie is insanity
Unappreciated at the time of its release for its visionary and iconic style, Wild At Heart today deserves its place as one of the greatest films of the late 20th century, and certainly one of the best films of the 1990s. Personally, it's one of my favorite films of all time.
It's violent, and entertaining at times. But I just don't like David Lynch. I just can't get into any of his movies. They are all just so over-the-top.
Well its definitely is entertaining. However, it never comes together as the surreal masterpiece that it wants to be.
Lynch Lynch Lynch. His unique style is evident in everything he touches. Disturbing and sweet.
I always wanted to use this term to describe a film: "Rollicking". Well, there's that.
Graphic,surrealist and disturbing lovers-in-lam story supported by mighty plays and unexpected and ironic end.
awesome bit of weirdarama from Lynch
Think Wizard of Oz...Set it in modern time. Have a somewhat realistic element to it. More dark and bizarre. Make the characters, locations and events barely comparable to it. And you have Wild At Heart sorta
You know you've arrived as a filmmaker when a bespoke adjective is created to describe your work - Gilliam-esque, Kubrickian, Lynchian and so on. But with this honour comes the danger of said film-maker producing films which consist of familiar images or elements, without the narrative or thematic cohesion which earned them the label in the first place. Wild of Heart is only partially guilty of this, not being one of David Lynch's strongest or most cohesive efforts. Although its thematic unity is never in doubt, and its central narrative is easy enough to follow, it ultimately amounts to a series of strange and memorable moments which punctuate his loose reworking of a road movie. While episodic and baggy, it contains moments of Lynch at his absolute best, and even at its worst is nothing short of unforgettable. Just as Lynch saw Eraserhead as his version of The Philadelphia Story, so Wild at Heart could be described as his take on The Wizard of Oz. Lynch has acknowledged its influence throughout his career, and his most recent works, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire, have incorporated visual or narrative references to it throughout. But whereas these films are Lynch works with little nods to Oz thrown in, this is a full-on marriage of the two, as Lynch takes all the touchstones of L. Frank Baum's story, adds plenty of violence, cranks up the creepiness (if that were possible), and makes the central relationship more emotionally raw and raunchy. The parallels between the two works are candid from the outset. Lula is Dorothy, thrust into a strange world that is "wild at heart and weird on top", and sustained only by Sailor's companionship and the promise of returning to something she can recognise. Sailor in this interpretation is an amalgam of Dorothy's companions: he's physically strong but an emotional coward, lacks brains, and his capacity for love doesn't extend much beyond devotion. Alternatively, these two represent different aspects of Dorothy, contrasting Sailor's self-confidence with Lula's sensitivity. The Oz references extend far beyond the permutations of the central characters. Diane Ladd makes a convincing Wicked Witch of the West, following Lula's/ Dorothy's every move, cursing the fact that the couple are still together and getting further towards their goal in spite of all her schemes. The long road to California doubles for the yellow brick road, and the car crash featuring Twin Peaks star Sherilyn Fenn could be a nod to the poppy fields, which disorientate and threaten to destroy the heroes. Fenn later turns up as a literal manifestation of the Good Witch Glinda, reflecting that the couple's perseverance and desire to help her were both the right choices to make. Lynch described the central theme of Wild at Heart as "finding love in Hell". He creates a dark, violent world all around the characters, populated by car crashes, robberies, betrayal, infidelity, sex, violence and various undignified deaths. With all the supporting characters having at least one foot rooted in the grotesque, Sailor and Lula become our natural focus, as people with at least part of their sanity intact who desire more than anything to escape, by whatever means. This atmosphere of aggression and theme of being trapped is reinforced by Lynch's choice of music. Working with Angelo Badalamenti, who has scored all his work since Blue Velvet, Lynch blends the laid-back 1950s sound of Chris Isaaks brilliant 'Wicked Game' to some very aggressive speed metal, the latter of which foreshadows his work with Marilyn Manson on Lost Highway. It's an oddly effective blend, depicting the violence and possible redemption which confront the characters. Music plays a key role in demonstrating the mental conflict of the central characters. In one great scene, Lula tunes through all the radio stations in the car, hearing nothing but bad news. She slams on the brakes, gets out of the car, and starts screaming that she'll go mad unless she hears music. Sailor finds some hard rock, starts screaming too, and they share an impromptu mosh in the middle of the desert, ending with a passionate embrace. There are big nods to the Elvis back catalogue, with Sailor serenading Lula with 'Love Me' in the club, and finally cementing his love with 'Love Me Tender' during the credits. Although these scenes in and of themselves are well-assembled and great fun, they do hint at the big central problem with Wild at Heart. There are so manystrange little bits floating around the central story that they never quite integrate into a seamless, disorientating whole. Lynch's symbolic imagery and manipulation of colour don't gel quite so naturally with the story and characters as such techniques did in Blue Velvet or Mulholland Drive. The Blue Velvet comparison is the more illuminating, particularly with regard to the amount of time the ideas of the film had to gestate. Lynch had the story and themes of Blue Velvet all worked out in his head before Dune, so that even when he was forced to shoot quickly due to lack of money, he knew how to shoot the robins speech, or the zoom down to the cockroaches, in a way which was seamlessly integral to the story. Wild at Heart, on the other hand, was rushed into production following the collapse of Dino DeLaurentiis' production company, which delayed progress on both Twin Peaks and Lynch's pet project, Ronnie Rocket. He was given Barry Gifford's novel by friend Monty Montgomery with a view to producing it, and only had two months between buying the rights and beginning to shoot. It is no surprise therefore that the script of Wild at Heart doesn't entirely click; it is, in Lynch's words, "a compilation of ideas." This disjointed feel has the side effect of taking us out of the story during many of the weirder moments. The cameos by Jack Nance or Crispin Glover may induce a laugh, but the reaction they produce is one of puzzlement rather than mesmerism. Some of Badalamenti's musical cues are overcooked, such as the huge dramatic chord when Sailor pulls up at Perdita's house. And the final scene, where Sailor and Lula reaffirm their love, lacks the beauty and irony of Blue Velvet's ending, which manages to be both uplifting and watchful. Despite some self-imposed cuts on Lynch's part, there are many scenes in Wild at Heart which remain problematic. The violence is par for the course for an 18 certificate, even the sight of Willem Dafoe's character losing his head with a shotgun. But the sexual advances of Dafoe's character are deeply disturbing for all the wrong reasons, and the recurring image of Lula's rape does nothing but turn our stomachs. Ultimately, the performances in Wild at Heart are enough to see things through. Nicolas Cage is on startling form, showing that he thrives when given a director who understands melodrama and exaggerated characters. He may be massively over-the-top, but it makes sense, and his Elvis impersonation is great. Laura Dern's unusual beauty fits the Southern belle look of her character, and we believe in her emotional turmoil throughout. Amongst the hysterical supporting case, including Dern's real-life mother Diane Ladd, the stand-out is Harry Dean Stanton, who stands calm in the eye of the storm, looking as bemused as the rest of us. Wild at Heart is not Lynch's finest work by any stretch of the imagination. It has structural deficiencies which were not sorted out in the editing room, and the lurches in tone may prove too much for the casual viewer. But in the moments when it does work - and there are plenty - it is an often joyous reminder of Lynch's power as a film-maker, telling stories in ways which are frighteningly unique. While no masterpiece, nor an ideal starting point, it is often majestic and always memorable.
Small and intimate movie about the resiliency of a little girl in the face of adversity, pain and change.
Without trying to sound sexist i am the wrong gender to appreciate this flick. I did find it quite laughable at the end when i really wasnt supposed to. Lynch - why?
I love thsi film Very well acted. Wonderful filming and scenery! A MUST SEE
